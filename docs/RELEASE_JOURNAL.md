## Action journal

- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-35 Slice 2a DONE — VWB-24 consumed same-day; device suite 41/43.** The bridge
  typed the HVAC params (v1.3): full ru/en/de triplets, and for the first time wire ≠ canonical
  ("COOL"/"cool") — the fixture guard now validates the CANONICAL set, which is what Irene sends
  (§5a). `_hvac_choice` matches the spoken word against the device's OWN triplets (labels +
  canonicals through the shared option matcher, transliteration hints included) with an
  ACTION-aware device pick — only the HVACs carry set_mode, so «кондиционер на охлаждение» never
  clarifies against a plain heater; set_fan's param is named `fan`, not `speed`. F80
  («охлаждение»→cool) and F81 («скорость 2»→speed_2) green live. One ops gotcha burned an hour:
  a STALE mock bridge from earlier debugging still owned the port and served the pre-VWB-24
  golden — empty mode values, while every in-process repro passed; `device-auto` now kills any
  squatter first. The only red anywhere remains F40/F42 — the parked QUAL-64 pair.


- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-35 Slice 2 COMPLETE (Part B, code pushed with the guide; ledger line landed
  one commit later) — device suite 39/41; the only red anywhere is the parked QUAL-64 pair.**
  Part B: tracks audio/subtitles (subtitles got its own verb «смени» — «переключи» scores as
  input_select in the untuned matcher, one more QUAL-64 exhibit), screen aspects as CHOICE+target
  (two screen-capable devices in the living room), menu navigation as a 7-way CHOICE, presence
  «мы дома»/«мы уходим», cleaning start + «уборка на 30 минут», and the water alarm — device found
  by its alarm+leaks capability PAIR (never an id literal), keeping the heating alarm out per the
  user decision. Adjudications settled: no further units abstraction needed (one catalog-range
  path serves dB/%/°C); declarative room_context enforcement closed as satisfied-by-implementation.
  Suite 1314 green, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts. **Immediately after: bridge accepted + implemented
  VWB-24 (typed HVAC set_mode/set_fan) — folded in as Slice 2a** (re-pin + CHOICE wiring +
  fixtures), starting now.


- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-35 Slice 2 Part A DONE (`bedc867`) — device suite 33/35; all eight new
  fixtures green on the first live run.** Wired per the interactive decisions: volume
  up/down/set/mute_toggle (the processor's dB range −96..0 honestly enforced by the shared catalog
  range pre-validation), playback play/stop/next/previous + a seek CHOICE (ff/rewind) with
  `play_pause` fallback for split-action-less devices (the Zappiti), cover.set_position in both
  address forms («наполовину»→50; the room form rides VWB-23 `params`), and the power-verb
  fallback — «включи обогрев» → climate.on, «включи вытяжку» → fan.set(2) — closing the census gap
  where climate/fan devices ignored on/off verbs. The routing-risk fixture (F62 «выключи звук на
  телеке» vs the power_off phrase) routed correctly. +10 donation methods; one extractor trap
  re-learned: target regexes must keep a SINGLE capture group. Part B
  (tracks/screen/menu-nav/presence/cleaning/water-alarm) follows; scope already in the ledger.


- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-35 Slice 2 scope decided (interactive, capability-by-capability from the
  pinned-golden census).** Eleven decisions: volume all-four; playback everything incl. ff/rewind
  (play_pause only as the fallback for split-action-less devices); cover.set_position in both
  address forms with «наполовину»→50; climate on/off via power-verb fallback (the census showed
  «включи обогрев» silently fails today); hood fan with «включи»→speed 2; tracks audio/subtitles +
  screen aspects + a menu nav subset (user overrode the skip-lean: track dialogs need navigation on
  some devices; pointer stays out); presence home/away; cleaning start+delay; water_supply alarm
  only. Skipped with intent: power.toggle, seasonal_mode, heating_control alarm — and ALL FOUR
  VALVES as a permanent voice fence. One contract gap found while checking facts: HVAC
  set_mode/set_fan params are bare strings (no triplets/options_from — the G5 disease again) →
  **bridge VWB-24 filed uncommitted**; «кондиционер на охлаждение» waits for the typing re-pin.
  Implementation follows in this session; scope recorded first so the decisions survive it.

- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-35 restructured (3 slices; the local-LLM T3 concept retired) + Slice 1 DONE —
  device suite 25/27; every red is now QUAL-64's.** Reconciliation first (user): most of QUAL-35's
  historical scope was already satisfied by today's arc — typed donations, the Q7b swap, D-15,
  `options_from`, the units requirement, and the "compound numerals need T2" theory (dead — it was
  BUG-23/24). The T3 bullet's "dependency-parse / local-LLM, opt-in local-only" framing predated
  QUAL-50 and is retired: the third cascade tier EXISTS (the donation-grounded LLM NLU provider
  through LLMPort — DeepSeek with an API key, abstains offline) but is not enabled in any deployment
  config; Slice 3 measures it instead of building anything new. The plan: Slice 1 transliteration,
  Slice 2 capability breadth (volume, playback rest, cover positions, HVAC mode, fan + two
  adjudications; menu/pointer and the global valve/mode specials held for explicit user decision),
  Slice 3 hard-phrasing fixtures measured against spaCy patterns + the enabled QUAL-50 tier (after
  the QUAL-64 matcher tune, so fallback tiers aren't built against an untuned first tier).
  **Slice 1 landed the same session:** `latin_to_cyrillic_hint` reuses the in-house TTS transcription
  engine — "YouTube" renders as «ютуб» *exactly* — plus an acronym letter-name table (TV→«ти ви»,
  where the engine would say «тэлевижен»); option matching and scenario-label scoring now also
  compare against the hint, with «э»→«е» folding. One iteration bump: the hint transcriber must
  carry the FULL PrepareNormalizer option shape (a partial dict KeyError'd on the mixed-script
  label «Кино с LD-проигрывателя» — caught live by the suite, of course). F41 + F53 green;
  F41/F42/F53 retiered to 1. Suite 1269 green, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts.

- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-44 DONE (+ BUG-23/BUG-24 found & fixed under it) — device suite 23/27; every
  remaining red is deliberate.** The arbitration landed exactly as the entry scoped it: on a
  clarifying turn the pipeline now runs NLU on the BARE new utterance first — a confident,
  non-fallback recognition is a fresh command (pending dropped, logged, processed clean); fragments
  and low-confidence turns combine as before. One extra NLU pass, clarifying turns only; abandonment
  is silent. The regression fakes became text-aware — an everything-recognizes-at-0.9 fake would have
  defeated the arbitration invisibly. Chasing the residual F51 red through the live stack
  (`spoken: "hdmiодин"` in the new clarification metadata) unearthed two real input-corruption bugs:
  **BUG-23** — the `numbers` normalizer (digits→words, the SYNTHESIS direction) ran on `asr_output`,
  fighting BUG-1's pre-NLU words→digits and garbling «hdmi1»/«25» (the true cause of F06's range
  error, previously misread as a T2 compound-numeral limit); now `tts_input`-only in defaults +
  config-master + explicit normalizer blocks in all 6 docker configs (user request). **BUG-24** —
  ovos maps standalone «пол» to 0.5, so «тёплый пол» lost its device noun; now sentinel-guarded
  unless a measure word follows («пол часа» still converts). A user question caught a third latent
  one en route: the `-en` configs inherited `latin_to_cyrillic: true` — an English deployment would
  transliterate its whole TTS input; the `-en` blocks now pin `latin_to_cyrillic = false` +
  `language = "en"`. **Result: `make device-auto` 23/27** — F05/F06/F07 retiered to 1 in the fixtures
  (eval-commons `3b959e0`; the "T2 compound numerals" theory is dead, it was pipeline corruption);
  the 4 red are exactly F40/F42 (QUAL-64 matcher tune, user-parked) and F41/F53 (genuine T2
  transliteration). Suite 1266 green, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts.

- **2026-07-05 — QUAL-65 DONE — input switching + app launch by voice (bridge VWB-19 consumed);
  the options_from dance built; QUAL-44 un-deferred by what the suite caught.** Re-pinned @ bridge
  `3bed556` / catalog `dbfd2855` (select-form canonical routing, `canonical_first.md` §11): by_value
  inputs (mf_amplifier, upscaler) carry static value triplets with `labels: null` — technical
  identifiers, wire=canonical=table key — so the ru-labels pin guard learned the distinction (null
  legal, non-null still requires ru); parametric inputs + apps carry `options_from`. The QUAL-35
  resolver-note-(1) machinery arrived ahead of schedule: `read_options(device_id, kind)` on the read
  port, 30s TTL cache in CatalogService, fail-soft `BridgeClient.get_device_options`. Two handler
  methods share one option matcher built on the resolver's own normalization; an unmatched value
  clarifies by reading back what IS available. Four new fixtures (F50–F53) + mock-bridge options
  endpoint; the input-switching exclusion is lifted from fixtures, QUAL-35 note (3), and the user
  guide. **Live: F50 green end-to-end** («переключи усилитель на cd» — validated offline, zero
  round-trips); 20/27. **F51–F53's red turned out to be gold:** not routing at all (the matcher probe
  routes all three correctly, 0.75–0.79) but **QUAL-44 in the flesh** — F20's legitimately-armed
  clarification consumed the next same-room case as its "answer" («поставь на паузу переключи телек
  на hdmi1»), re-armed, and poisoned the cascade; the same bleed retroactively explains part of
  F42's earlier behavior. User decision: QUAL-44 un-deferred and implemented next; the device suite
  runs `-j 1` from now on (shared per-room sessions make parallel cases one interleaved
  conversation, not independent tests). Suite 1262 green, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts,
  eval-commons 40 (`cc1cba9`).

- **2026-07-05 — ARCH-8 PR-5 DONE → ARCH-8 CLOSES — the whole MQTT smart-home arc landed in one day;
  device suite 19/23.** The sensor-read flow: `read_state(device_id)` joined `DeviceCatalogPort` as a
  QUERY (reads never ride the OutputManager, §13.3), `CatalogService` carries a wired state-reader,
  `BridgeClient.get_device_state` GETs `/devices/{id}/state` fail-soft, and the handler's
  `_handle_read_state` (donation: quantity CHOICE temperature/humidity with RU surfaces, room via
  D-15) picks the reading source with two deliberate preferences the tests pin: a dedicated `sensor`
  capability beats a climate unit, and on climate devices the MEASURED `room_temperature` is read —
  the bare `temperature` field there is the thermostat SETPOINT («уставка» per the catalog's own
  labels), a silent wrong-value trap. Live: F30–F32 went green (`make device-auto` → **19/23**; the
  4 red are all owned: F40/F42 → QUAL-64, F41/F06 → QUAL-35 T2). Suite 1255 green, pyright 0, 11/11
  contracts. **The deferred user-facing promise is delivered with ARCH-8's completion:**
  `docs/guides/smart-home.md` — how voice control works (catalog-driven vocabulary, depth of
  phrasing, clarifications, sensor questions), how to enable `[outputs.bridge]`, current limits —
  linked from the README. Remaining in the MQTT lane: QUAL-35 T2/units + breadth (evidence now
  flowing from the suite), QUAL-64 matcher tune, then the hardware tiers (ARCH-25).

- **2026-07-05 — TEST-18 DONE (Slice B) — the producer contract suite is EXECUTABLE; first scoreboard
  16/23.** The capture side landed as a **mock bridge** (eval-commons `1bc7b03`), refining §14.3's
  in-process capture into something strictly more end-to-end: `eval_commons/mock_bridge.py` serves the
  PINNED golden catalog at `/system/catalog` and records every canonical POST fixture-shaped — so a run
  exercises the real BridgeClient wire serialization AND the real startup catalog pull, not just the
  handler. `device_command_provider` drives `/execute/command`; `device_command_assert` compares
  against the fixture `expect`; `fixtures_to_tests` GENERATES the promptfoo cases so the pinned
  fixtures stay the single source of truth. Voice side: `eval/device.promptfooconfig.yaml`,
  `make device / device-auto` (the auto target derives the SUT config from config-master because
  pydantic-settings init kwargs beat env for nested sections), target-profile URLs, eval README.
  **Scoreboard: 16/23** — every tier-1 actuation + clarify fixture green end-to-end (device forms,
  all six VWB-23 room-group forms incl. scope auto/all and room aliases, both clarifications). The
  7 red, each owned: F30–F32 reads → ARCH-8 PR-5; F41 transliteration + F06 compound numeral
  («двадцать пять» mis-extracted; «двадцать два» fine) → QUAL-35 T2's first suite-collected evidence;
  F40/F42 scenario routing → **QUAL-64** (filed): the keyword matcher — never tuned — scores short
  verb phrases over longer specific ones («выключи кино» → power_off despite scenario_stop carrying
  that exact phrase at boost 1.3), then dips under the 0.7 threshold live → LLM fallback. User
  decision: leave them red, tune the matcher deliberately (a drafted handler-level scenario fallback
  was reverted in favor of that). En route, **BUG-22** found + fixed: `/execute/command`'s room_alias
  validation NEVER worked — web_server built a web-templates-only asset loader, so localization
  consumers saw empty data; it now reuses the intent system's fully-loaded loader, and the rooms
  localization gained the house's rooms. TEST-18 moved active → done; next: ARCH-8 PR-5 (the reads
  go green).

- **2026-07-05 — ARCH-8 PR-4 DONE (+ QUAL-35 T1 donations & clarify policy) — «включи свет в
  детской» now travels the whole pipeline: NLU → resolver → handler → canonical command → spoken
  outcome.** The reference smart-home handler (`smart_home.py`, 9 donation-routed methods) closes
  the vertical slice. The T1 donation is the first with non-generic `entity_type` declarations
  (target=device, room=room) — the PR-3 Q7b swap now runs its declarative path in production. The
  noun lexicon landed as donation data, not code: the `group_noun` CHOICE param's canonical values
  ARE the catalog's semantic group names (light/cover) with the RU surfaces
  (свет/шторы/жалюзи/занавески) as choice_surfaces — bound to catalog truth at execution (the
  handler refuses a room-group command for a room with no such group members), guarded by a
  word-boundary check so a device NAMED «Подсветка потолка» never false-triggers the light group.
  «весь/все» flips `scope: auto → all`. Delivery goes through a new Any-typed domain port
  (`DeviceCommandDeliveryPort` — pure per the import contract) implemented by
  `DeviceCommandDispatcher` over the OutputManager with a 7-second bound; a timeout, a missing
  bridge, or a missing catalog each get their own honest spoken degradation. The §5b error enum
  maps to feminine-ru templates; `param_invalid`, same-room ambiguity (F20/F21 — the v1 clarify
  decision), out-of-range setpoints (pre-validated against the pinned catalog's min/max — most
  param_invalid never round-trips) and missing slots all arm the QUAL-30/31 one-shot
  clarification; a partial room-group aggregate names its failed members («…, но не ответили:
  Бра»). 22 fixture-mirroring tests drive the REAL resolver → handler → OutputManager → capturing
  bridge and assert byte-equal fixture `expect` shapes; a live webapi run confirmed the real NLU
  cascade routes «включи свет в детской»/«включи телек» to `smart_home.power_on` while greetings
  and timers stay untouched. Suite 1250 green, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts. Handler enabled in
  config-master + all 6 docker configs (domain priority 80). TEST-18's tier-1 fixtures are now
  green-able — Slice B makes them executable. Two side-fixes: the smoke-e2e 500 was a stale
  editable-install entry-point map (uv sync refreshes it), and the recurring dev-venv trap's root
  cause fell out — the untracked `.python-version` pinned the broken /usr/local 3.11.4; it now
  pins the uv-managed 3.11.12 (memory updated). Next: PR-5 (sensor read) closes ARCH-8.

- **2026-07-05 — ARCH-8 PR-3 DONE (with the QUAL-35 resolver half) — spoken references now resolve
  against the real device catalog.** Three moves in `entity_resolver.py`. **The Q7b atomic swap
  (QUAL-35 b):** dispatch is declarative-first — a donation-declared `entity_type` routes the param
  straight to the device/room resolver (map built from the loaded donations); the old
  `_is_device_entity`/`_is_location_entity` name-heuristics remain only as the fallback for
  generic/undeclared params, so every existing handler behaves identically until PR-4's smart-home
  donations declare real types. **Catalog-backed device resolution:** name+alias surfaces per locale,
  exact then RU-morphology-tolerant (a shared-stem heuristic — ≥4-char stem with ≤3-char endings —
  because plain fuzz.ratio scores «детской»/«детская» at 71, under any sane threshold), room-context
  disambiguation for shared aliases, name-level ambiguity surfaced as candidates for the clarify path
  («ночники» → both sconces, per the v1 decision), and the ARCH-26 lazy re-pull exactly once on a
  miss. **Room resolution + D-15:** catalog rooms by name/alias/id, then the ARCH-22 coverage policy —
  a mentioned room the client covers is the target, a real room it does not cover returns
  `uncovered_room` (spoken error, no actuation), and `global` is exempt so whole-house asks
  («выключи весь свет в квартире») work from any satellite; `resolve_default_room` implements
  rule 3 (no room → primary). The legacy client-context paths survive untouched for catalog-less
  deployments. Wiring rides `nlu_component` → `core.catalog_service`. 14 new tests; live
  spot-checks against the real pinned golden: 12/12, including the resolution leg of every
  device-form crossover fixture (телек/эппл/радиаторах/пол/розетки/тюль слева + room aliases
  зал/квартире/сынарник). Suite 1228 passed, pyright 0, 11/11 contracts. QUAL-35 keeps (a) T1
  donations and the handler-side room_context policy for PR-4, and the heavy tiers for after the
  suite runs. Next: PR-4 — the reference device handler end-to-end.

- **2026-07-05 — PR-2 placement amendment (user decision): one home for all OutputPorts + explicit
  bridge surface in the 6 deployment configs.** `BridgeClient` moved
  `providers/outputs/bridge.py` → `outputs/bridge.py`; the `irene.providers.outputs` entry-point
  group is retired (nothing discovered outputs via entry-points — the composition imports and
  registers directly from `[outputs.bridge]` config) and its ARCH-4 independence entry removed;
  `mqtt_integration.md` §4/§8/§10/§13.1 amended with dated notes so the design doc matches reality.
  The 6 docker-image configs (standalone-x86_64, embedded-aarch64, embedded-armv7 × ru/en) — which
  carried no `[outputs]` section at all (silent defaults) — now declare `[outputs]` +
  `[outputs.bridge]` explicitly (disabled; the flip-on belongs to the ARCH-25 hardware bring-up
  once the bridge's ops cutover lands); all 6 validate against `CoreConfig`. Suite 1214 green,
  11/11 contracts, pyright 0.

- **2026-07-05 — ARCH-8 PR-2 DONE — the real bridge adapter; Irene can now (config-gated) speak REST to
  wb-mqtt-bridge and pull the device catalog.** `BridgeClient` (`providers/outputs/bridge.py`, the only
  module that knows the bridge exists) implements the designated DEVICE_COMMAND OutputPort: device-form
  commands POST to `/devices/{id}/canonical`, room-group commands to `/rooms/{room_id}/canonical`
  (VWB-23), responses map to the rich DeliveryResult — post-action `state` / per-member `results` as
  the echo, the §5b error enum as `error_code` with `param_invalid`'s field+reason preserved for the
  clarify path, and a bridge that is down becomes a spoken `bridge_unreachable`, never an exception in
  the pipeline. Its `parse_catalog` builds the domain `DeviceCatalog` and was verified against the real
  pinned golden (79 devices / 11 rooms @ `91909b54`; children_room light default, global→all_lights
  membership, °C/% typed params, scenario ru labels, `options_from`, «зал»/«радиаторы» aliases all
  survive the round-trip). Wiring: new `[outputs.bridge]` config section (enabled/base_url/timeout;
  documented in config-master, config-ui `OutputConfig`/`BridgeOutputConfig` types co-changed — the
  section editor renders nested objects generically; `npm run check` + `build` clean),
  `CatalogService` now built by `build_core` and carried on the engine, and a runner-agnostic
  `setup_bridge_output()` hook in the composition (called by the base runner after `core.start()`)
  registers + designates the output, wires the catalog fetcher, and attempts one non-fatal startup
  pull — the ARCH-26 lazy refresh covers a bridge that boots later. Placement decision recorded (user
  question): BridgeClient sits under the `irene.providers.outputs` entry-point group per §13.1 —
  an external-system adapter (configured, designated), not a channel sink like `irene/outputs/`;
  the category joined the ARCH-4 independence contract. One test-harness fix along the way:
  the master-config completeness test's section-rename mutation now renames `[outputs.*]` sub-tables
  too (a surviving `[outputs.bridge]` implicitly recreates the parent — TOML super-table semantics).
  13 new tests; suite 1214 passed, pyright 0 errors, 11/11 import contracts, config-ui clean.
  Smart-home user-guide prose deliberately waits for PR-4/PR-5. Next: PR-3 — catalog into the
  resolver.

- **2026-07-05 — ARCH-8 PR-1 DONE — the canonical-command boundary exists in code; the MQTT arc's spine
  starts.** Adapter-free by design, built the same day as the fixtures it must eventually satisfy.
  Domain (`irene/intents/`): `device_commands.py` — `DeviceCommand` (device form; scenarios ride it) and
  `RoomGroupCommand` + `GroupScope` (VWB-23 room form), each with the fixture-shaped `to_dict()` (kinds
  `actuate`/`room-group`, matching `crossover_fixtures.json` vocabulary) and the wire-shaped
  `request_body()`; commands travel in `IntentResult.metadata["device_command"]` per §13.2.
  `device_catalog.py` — the typed catalog model mirroring the pinned contract (params
  values-XOR-`options_from` with units/ranges, capability `group` tags, room `group_defaults`, and the
  `group_members`/`group_default` queries the resolver will use). `DeviceCatalogPort` joined
  `intents/ports.py` (QUAL-24 pattern) carrying the ARCH-26 lazy-refresh seam as `async refresh()`.
  Application: `core/catalog_service.py` holds the snapshot, serializes concurrent refreshes, and never
  discards the last good catalog on a failed pull; PR-2 wires its fetcher. Delivery:
  `outputs/device_command.py` — `CapturingDeviceCommandOutput`, the fake bridge that IS the TEST-18
  capture point (records both address forms, returns the rich echo `DeliveryResult`, scriptable §5b
  error responder). No `ActuationPort` — the bridge is an OutputPort (§13.6). 15 new unit tests incl.
  end-to-end designated routing through the OutputManager; suite 1201 passed, pyright 0 errors.
  Follow-up hardening (user question, same session): a new import-linter contract — "Domain ports and
  boundary types stay pure" — pins `intents/{ports,models,device_commands,device_catalog}` against
  `irene.core`, closing a gap ARCH-1 cannot cover (intents as a whole carries sanctioned core edges:
  donations, trace, the durable seam — so only a module-scoped rule can forbid the port→application
  inversion, same shape as the SCC-2 input-port contract); 11/11 contracts kept.
  TEST-18 Slice B ungated. Next: PR-2 (BridgeClient adapter + catalog pull).

- **2026-07-05 — TEST-18 Slice A DONE — the crossover fixture set exists; the MQTT arc now builds against
  a failing suite.** Resumed the paused interactive session; the three open decisions closed (user):
  light-subset pair nouns («ночники»/«тумбочки»/«полки») dropped from v1 — bridge-side compound devices
  will come later and re-enter via a re-pin; same-room capability ambiguity clarifies in v1 with priority
  rules filed as QUAL-63 for a later release; sensor reads included. Authored
  `eval-commons/contracts/crossover_fixtures.json` (`941e245`): 23 `{utterance → canonical command}`
  fixtures against pinned catalog `91909b54` spanning all four expect kinds — device-form actuation via
  aliases and typed °C/% params, VWB-23 room-group commands (scope `auto` vs «весь»→`all`, room aliases
  «зал»/«квартира»), reads (with `any_of` for the two physically-equivalent bedroom temperature sources),
  clarifications (F20 playback, F21 climate), plus the scenario enum by RU label and a transliteration
  case. Each fixture carries a tier (1 = green-able with the QUAL-35 T1 donation baseline at ARCH-8 PR-4;
  2 = needs T2 units/transliteration). A new 8-test guard suite (`test_crossover_fixtures.py`) binds every
  fixture to catalog truth — device ids, actions, param ranges, enum wires, groups, sensor fields — and
  pins the fixtures' `catalog_version` to `PIN.json`, so the next re-pin points at exactly which fixtures
  go stale; 16/16 green with the pin guards. The bridge's VWB-16 consumer half can consume the file as-is.
  Next per the recorded sequence: ARCH-8 PR-1.

- **2026-07-05 — VWB-23 analyzed + contract RE-PINNED — «включи свет» became one REST call; the boundary
  is now address-form polymorphic.** The bridge shipped room-scoped group addressing (`canonical_first.md`
  §10, surfaced by this side's TEST-18 Slice A question "what does «включи свет в детской» resolve to?"):
  `POST /rooms/{room_id}/canonical {group, action, scope: auto|all|one}` — the depth doctrine (resolve only
  as deep as the utterance specifies; the device pick is bridge POLICY via `group_defaults`, not resolver
  heuristics), a `group` overlay on capabilities (37 illumination `power` caps tagged `light`; oven/plugs
  split to `power_switch` so «свет» can never reach them), all 10 rooms defaulting `light` → `<room>_spots`,
  fan-out allow-listed to `light`+`cover`, per-member aggregate responses. Verified against the committed
  artifacts and **re-pinned** into eval-commons (`e0d6b45`, catalog `91909b54`, all 8 pin guards green —
  the guard suite did its job on its first real re-pin). Ledger adjusted: ARCH-8 gained the
  three-address-form addendum (PR-1 models device + room-group commands; PR-4 noun lexicon bound to catalog
  `group` truth + singular/«весь»→scope mapping + aggregate-response speech); QUAL-35 gained the depth
  doctrine + the no-power-fan-out fence; TEST-18 Slice A: **Q1 (room lights) RESOLVED by VWB-23**, Q2
  narrowed to light-subset pairs only («ночники»/«тумбочки» — cover pairs dissolved into room-group
  fan-out), Q3/Q4 still open, fixture schema gains the `room-group` expect kind. Slice A stays paused on
  the three remaining user decisions.

- **2026-07-05 — TEST-17 DONE — the contract is pinned; both repos now test against the same committed
  boundary.** The bridge's v1.1 artifacts (bridge `59f4f46`, catalog `7a1149c7`) copied byte-identical into
  `eval-commons/contracts/` with a voice-side `PIN.json` and a consumer README (bridge generates, voice
  re-pins, both suites read this copy — no cross-repo writes, §14 publish boundary). The pin is load-bearing,
  not decorative: 8 new eval-commons tests validate the golden against the pinned `CatalogResponse` schema
  itself (the two halves of the pin cannot disagree), check STAMP↔PIN↔golden version agreement, and assert
  the v1.1 shape guarantees (authored aliases, ru enum labels, °C/% units, `values`-XOR-`options_from`, no
  empty capability husks) — so accidentally re-pinning a pre-patch artifact fails in seconds. Deliberately
  sequenced pin-after-patch: the first pin is the only pin. Carve-outs recorded in the ledger entry: the
  real WB7 dump rides the bridge's controller cutover; the crossover fixtures co-develop with ARCH-8
  PR-1/TEST-18. The MQTT arc's opening move is done — ARCH-8 PR-1 is next.

- **2026-07-05 — The bridge contract is voice-ready; ARCH-8's gate is met and the conclusions are in the
  ledger.** Closes the loop opened 2026-07-04, when the user asked how smart-home intents get their donations
  before starting ARCH-8. The analysis of the freshly committed bridge `contracts/` established the story —
  **donations are NEVER generated from the contract**: donations carry the static device-agnostic grammar
  (verbs, typed slots), the catalog supplies the entity/value vocabulary at runtime (lazy, ARCH-26), the
  resolver marries them — and found five gaps (schema-less `CatalogAction.params`, no aliases, EN-only enum
  labels, no units on params, enum-in-disguise `apps.launch`). Filed bridge-side; intake verified 4 of 5 and
  **refuted the G5 remedy** (the app set is runtime-dynamic — a static enum in the golden would drift on
  every app install, the exact disease QUAL-18 diagnosed; corrected to an `options_from` hint +
  `GET /devices/{id}/options/<kind>`, which adds a clean THIRD vocabulary tier: fully-dynamic per-device
  sets). Bridge landed **VWB-20 contract patch v1.1** (typed `CatalogParam` with unit/values/options_from,
  ru+en enum labels, aliases schema, husks suppressed) **and VWB-21** (household alias vocabulary: 34
  devices + 3 rooms) — all six items verified against the committed artifacts (catalog `7a1149c7`, bridge
  `59f4f46`). Ledger annotated so the conclusions survive this chat: ARCH-8 gate flipped to MET with the
  PR-2/PR-3 build notes; QUAL-35 gained the resolver-design notes (options_from as a second CHOICE source
  with lazy-miss + short-TTL cache; Cyrillic↔Latin transliteration-tolerant matching for device-reported
  proper nouns — «ютуб» vs "YouTube"; v1 command set excludes input switching until bridge VWB-19);
  TEST-17 un-deferred → `[release]` P2 with the pin target recorded. Next: TEST-17 pin → ARCH-8 PR-1.

- **2026-07-04 — QUAL-18 DONE (re-scoped) — the AsyncAPI subsystem is retired; the WebSocket protocols
  finally have accurate documentation.** The user asked for a deep dig before implementation, and the dig
  changed everything: the live `/asyncapi.json` emitted **zero channels** (verified against a running
  server) — all four documented endpoints had been deleted by ARCH-21/ARCH-10 while the four real ones
  (`/ws/audio`, `/ws/audio/reply`, `/ws/observe`, `/ws/output`) were never in the spec. ~1,400 LOC of
  bespoke generator+renderer were rendering an empty page, and the "code-first docs can't drift" premise
  had self-refuted (decorators document claims, not what `send_json` does). The 2026 ecosystem check found
  the renderer side solved (`@asyncapi/react-component` v3.1.3, offline-vendorable) but still no maintained
  FastAPI-WS→AsyncAPI introspector (fastws dead since 2023; FastStream still broker-shaped). Presented
  spec-as-artifact / code-first-rebuild / retire; **user chose retire + a user-facing guide.** Deleted
  ~2,000 LOC (generator, renderer, `irene/web_api/`, 7 dead WS message models, the interface method, 4
  routes, contract refs); wrote `docs/guides/websocket-api.md` — all four protocols frame-by-frame, the
  QUAL-55 canonical response frame, the reply channel's `speak_begin/PCM/speak_end` brackets,
  missed-announcement redelivery, a runnable Python example — plus a house-style diagram
  (`ws-protocols.dot/png`) and links from dataflow/esp32/howto-new-test. The web index page was also lying
  (linked `/asyncapi` and listed the deleted `/asr/stream|binary`) — repointed. Verified live: `/asyncapi*`
  404, index shows the guide pointer. Suite 1180 + smoke + 10 contracts green.

- **2026-07-04 — QUAL-55 DONE — the five execution surfaces speak one result shape.** The review's root
  cause (`api_result_contract_review.md`: no shared serializer, five hand-built dicts drifting apart) is
  closed with `irene/api/serializers.py::serialize_intent_result` — canonical
  `text`/`success`/`error`/`confidence`/`intent_name`/`timestamp`/`metadata`, with `intent_name` lifted from
  the orchestrator's `original_intent` and endpoint extras merged INTO the raw metadata rather than replacing
  it. REST `/execute/*` renamed `response`→`text` (the planned breaking change; `CommandResponse` reshaped),
  `/trace/*` `final_result` and both WS `response` frames now emit the same payload (superseding QUAL-54's
  metadata-injection stopgap). The "executed successfully" invented-prose fallbacks died with it (fail-loud).
  Cross-repo co-changes: config-ui types regenerated from the re-dumped OpenAPI (check+build green; no
  runtime consumer of the old field existed), eval-commons `ws_audio_provider` reads top-level `intent_name`
  with a metadata fallback so it spans SUT versions. The WS test fakes were replaced with the real
  `IntentResult` — hand-rolled fakes lacking `error` broke immediately, re-proving the review's F5 lesson
  that wrong-shaped fakes hide live bugs. Suite 1180 + smoke (live server asserts the canonical keys) +
  hexagon gate green.

- **2026-07-04 — REL-1 DONE — the Definition of Release is signed off; the road to release is now a closed,
  explicit list.** Interactive session. The checklist was reconciled criterion-by-criterion against current
  reality first: 6 of 8 exit criteria are already met with evidence (clean `uv sync` + CLI/WebAPI boots via the
  hermetic smoke suite; CI green since BUILD-9; pyright standard mode at 0 errors with an empty suppression
  list; 10 import-linter contracts; the test nets green; live model URLs re-verified this week by ASSET-4/5).
  The reconciliation surfaced one real gap: **no publish dispatch has ever run — no Docker image has ever been
  built for real**, so the Docker-boot clause was unproven → filed **BUILD-11** (first GHCR publish + boot
  validation + replace placeholder size budgets with real-size-derived ones). User decisions: the release
  artifact is a tag + published GHCR images (RU backends + config-ui); QUAL-18 and DOC-8 both STAY in release
  scope (all previously untagged tasks now carry explicit tags — the implicit-default ambiguity is gone);
  the vague "coverage understood" criterion replaced by the three named nets (unit + smoke e2e + eval CLI), no
  coverage-%; the target is the "scope-complete" milestone, not a calendar date. Remaining to release, in
  full: ARCH-8 (5 PRs) + QUAL-35 + QUAL-55 + QUAL-18 + DOC-8 (code/docs), ARCH-25 (hardware validation),
  BUILD-11 + REL-2 + REL-3 (release mechanics).

- **2026-07-04 — ARCH-29 + ASSET-5 DONE — «Ирина» lives in the server: wake-word model acquisition designed
  (interactive) and implemented; the training factory's first handoff consumed.** The user announced the first
  validated RU microWakeWord model (HF `droman42/microwakeword-irina-ru`, trained in
  `~/development/wakeword-training`) and asked for the model-sourcing architecture discussion. Design
  (`docs/design/wakeword_models.md`): a wake-word model is a v2 two-file pack (manifest + sibling `.tflite`);
  resolution is a 4-rung chain — local manifest path (pre-release testing) → wheel built-ins (the 4 stock EN
  packs ship inside pymicro-wakeword byte-identical to the esphome v2 repo, so «Alexa» as «Ирина»'s EN
  counterpart costs zero downloads) → v2 manifest URL (the escape hatch for microwakeword.com and
  not-yet-released HF models, per the user's "what if I train more?" question) → the released catalog on the
  provider class (piper-voices pattern; one line per validated word). Trigger layer stays semantics-free —
  word→room mapping waits for multi-room (ARCH-22/QUAL-35). Implementation: AssetManager multi-file packs
  (`files:` entries, staging + atomic rename) + `download_model_files()`; the provider's broken QUAL-20
  asset stub replaced by the real chain; both standalone configs switched to microwakeword («Ирина» RU /
  Alexa EN, per user request); voice-trigger guide rewritten; roster fixed everywhere («Борис» dropped — 2
  syllables; next: «Валера», «Наташа»; diagram regenerated). Live verification through the real provider:
  pack fetched from HF via the AssetManager, silence stays negative, and **16/16 synthetic + 6/6 real
  household «Ирина» recordings detect at the manifest's 0.97 cutoff** — an initial 0/16 scare was the harness
  truncating clips at the word's last sample (the sliding window needs trailing audio; a live mic always
  provides it). Suite 1173 green; both config validators green; smoke e2e green.

- **2026-07-04 — ASSET-4 DONE — silero VAD model download re-homed into the AssetManager; VAD warmup moved
  off the audio hot path.** A user-requested deep review of the VAD code ("where does the microVAD model come
  from?") answered the question two ways: **microVAD's model is compiled into the `pymicro-vad` wheel**
  (`micro_vad_cpp.abi3.so` — nothing to download, correctly outside asset management), but **silero VAD was
  self-downloading** — a synchronous, timeout-less `urllib.urlretrieve` fired on the *first audio frame*,
  blocking the event loop, retrying every frame when offline, and able to strand a truncated model file that
  its `size > 0` guard would trust forever. Root cause of the bypass: the AssetManager had no identity for the
  VAD family (`silero` is claimed by silero TTS in `provider_namespace_map`). Fixed by introducing the
  `silero_vad` asset name via a `(namespace, entry-point)` tuple mapping, declaring the model URL on
  `SileroVADProvider`, downloading in the provider's async `_do_initialize` through
  `download_model(..., url_override=)` (TOML `model_url` override kept), and adding a
  `VoiceSegmenter.initialize()` warmup seam that falls back to `energy` when the configured provider can't
  come up — so a fresh offline install degrades to working energy VAD instead of going silently deaf. On-disk
  path unchanged (`models/vad/silero_vad.onnx` — deployed volumes unaffected). Dead
  `create_audio_processor`/`process_audio_with_vad` deleted; stale VADEngine/vad_silero docstrings and
  `docs/guides/vad.md` updated. Suite 1162 green + `test_vad_assets.py` (10 new); verified live both ways
  (real download through the AssetManager; dead URL → energy fallback with the reason logged).

- **2026-07-02 — TEST-16 DONE — the Russian UX judge is calibrated against the user's own gold labels
  (κ = 1.0 in-sample).** The user suspected the task obsolete; reconciliation showed the opposite — it was
  blocked on exactly one thing only they could provide, so it was finished interactively: a regenerated 20-case
  set (the old probe died with its session scratchpad) was labeled live by the user (16 confident + 4 genuine
  borderlines, excluded from κ), then graded through the same llm-rubric→DeepSeek path as production. The human
  labels **inverted** the Claude-labeled probe's bias profile — the judge was too STRICT on terse voice replies
  («Окей.» is a fine confirmation) and too LENIENT on bureaucratese («код 502, обратитесь к администратору») —
  vindicating the human-gold gate. Two disciplined rubric iterations (re-measure everything each time):
  81%/κ0.625 → 94%/κ0.875 → **16/16, κ=1.0, stable across repeat runs**. En route, a real infrastructure find:
  the documented `file://…yaml#anchor` rubric-reference pattern NEVER worked in promptfoo (the fragment is
  treated as part of the filename — which is why the live suite carried inline copies); shared rubrics are now
  per-rubric `{ru,en}/*.txt` files, the yamls retired, and all four live UX cases reference the shared files
  directly (path proven live from `eval/`). Calibration set + gold + scorer + method housed in eval-commons
  `examples/ru-ux-calibration/` (their commit `4dd73d7`); ARCHITECTURE §7.1 flipped to CALIBRATED; EN rubrics
  got the same structural improvements, marked uncalibrated. **Russian UX pass/fail is now CI-trustworthy**,
  with the recorded caveats: κ is in-sample (fresh negatives as suites grow) and the set must be re-run after
  ANY rubric edit. TEST-16 moved active→done.

- **2026-07-02 — BUG-13 DONE (re-scoped with the user) — the streaming-branch hang is unreproducible; three
  real defects found by the repro are fixed.** Reconciliation ran a live repro (RU streaming pack, bounded
  utterance + `end`): the response arrives — the EOF-finalize has been in the tree since 2026-06-04, and the
  filed 30s hang belonged to the few-hours zipformer window (model rejected + removed same day; its
  endpoint-chops-bounded-commands behavior confirmed live — the online model loses "10 минут", exactly why
  satellites use offline Moonshine). Per the user's "re-scope + fix now": **(1)** the streaming branch now
  serves multiple utterances per connection (used to close after the first response — batch-floor parity
  restored); **(2)** a bounded client that stops sending without `end` no longer hangs forever — a 10s read-idle
  timeout force-finalizes (the plausible original culprit and a real hole regardless); **(3)** warm-up and the
  first request no longer race `_load_recognizer` into TWO model instances (2× RAM on the WB7) — double-checked
  lock in the base loader, subclass inherits. Stale zipformer claim in the EN config header corrected.
  Verified three ways: 2 new WS regression tests + 1 legacy fake made sherpa-honest; live SUT run (3 utterances
  on one socket, with and without `end`, all answered; recognizer loaded ONCE — was twice). Suite 1158 / 7
  skipped; pyright clean. BUG-13 moved active→done.

- **2026-07-02 — BUILD-10 DONE — the `ops/` deploy story lands; the BUILD-8 arc closes.** First: CI run 5
  (`7e2c50b`) is **fully green** — the new `ci.yml` gate side is validated end to end after the four-defect
  shakeout. Then the bridge's "deploy = pull, not build" pattern arrived here: `ops/docker-compose.yml` (Irene
  `:6000`, gitignored `../.assets` mount, 800m/1.5cpu with a tune-at-bring-up note; config-ui behind a compose
  `ui` profile per D-4), `ops/update.sh` (explicit per-subtree `rsync --delete` of the git-owned assets —
  donations/localization/prompts/templates/web + the contract schemas — then compose pull/up/prune; a sandbox
  test proved a planted model file and a durable-action record survive the sync), a systemd oneshot unit, and
  `ops/INSTALL.md` (install/update/rollback/EN-variant/recovery). The controller loop is now
  `git pull && ./ops/update.sh`, and the manual assets-artifact download is fully retired.
  `build-docker.md` deployment section rewritten around `ops/`. Remaining from the arc: the first real publish
  **dispatch** (validates the matrix + D-6 guards, yields actual sizes to tighten the budgets) and the on-WB7
  `update.sh` run (folds into ARCH-25 bring-up).

- **2026-07-02 — BUG-21 DONE + BUILD-9 CI shakeout — four live runs, four real defects, none of them the
  workflow's logic.** Greening the new `ci.yml` on real pushes surfaced, in order: **(1)** `.python-version` is a
  gitignored local pin → py-dev-gates needs an explicit `python-version: "3.11"`; **(2)** the `all` extra wasn't
  all — `tts-ruaccent` + `vad-tflite` missing (masked for months by `uv sync --all-extras`; exposed by the
  action's `pip install .[all,dev]`; pyright failed on `ruaccent`/`pymicro_vad` imports — packaging metadata, NOT
  a TTS-provider regression); **(3)** the config-validator step lost its `--config-dir configs/` arg in the port;
  **(4) = BUG-21**, spotted by the user's local run: the build-analyzer's "TTS but no audio output" rule predates
  ARCH-22 (satellites synthesize + stream to the ESP32 reply channel with no local audio — all four satellite
  profiles ❌ INVALID), AND `--validate-all-profiles` returned 0 regardless — the CI gate had been decorative in
  the old workflow too. Fixed: the rule now errors only when TTS has neither a local audio provider nor
  `web_api_enabled` (recorded on `BuildRequirements`), the tool exits 1 on any invalid profile, and
  `test_smoke_e2e.VENV_BIN` resolves next to `sys.executable` (the hardcoded `.venv/bin` broke in the pip-based
  CI env). All 12 profiles VALID; suite 1156 passed / 7 skipped locally.

- **2026-07-02 — BUILD-9 DONE — the one gated CI/publish workflow is live in the tree.** `ci.yml` replaces the
  three disconnected workflows (`backend-health`/`frontend-health`/`build-images`, deleted): a `changes`
  path-filter fans out to `ledger-guard` (`check_scope.py` finally runs in CI), `backend-health` (the shared
  **py-dev-gates@v0.1.1** trio with `install-extras: all,dev`, a NEW `uv lock --check` step to keep lockfile
  honesty since the gate env is pip-resolved, plus the voice-specific analyzer/config/dependency/arch gates and
  pytest), and `frontend-health`; publishing is dispatch-only, a `plan` job expands `targets`×`languages`
  inputs (default: all 6 backend images), every publish `needs:` green health — the publish-from-red-tree hole
  is closed. RU images keep unsuffixed names, EN adds `-en`; buildx cache per `<target>-<language>`. **D-6
  guards are live:** each pushed image is pulled by digest and the run fails if `/app/assets` is non-empty;
  size is budget-checked (placeholders 3.5/4.5/10 GB, to be tightened from the first dispatch's summary).
  **config-ui ships:** `config-ui/Dockerfile` (node:22 → nginx:alpine, one multi-arch manifest) with the
  runtime-config pattern — D-4 amended at implementation: NO nginx proxy (Irene's API has no path prefix and
  already serves permissive CORS); the entrypoint writes `/runtime-config.js` from `API_BASE_URL`, and the app
  defaults to `http://<page-hostname>:6000`. Verified locally: image built and smoke-run (env injection, SPA
  fallback, 200s), config-ui `check`/`build`/`test` green (40 tests). The assets GHA artifact is dropped
  (BUILD-10's git-pull sync replaces it; `build-docker.md` bridges the gap with a manual rsync note and now
  documents the 7-package family, EN pulls, dispatch UX, and the models-never-baked guarantee). Note: the
  workflow YAML parses clean; its live expression paths get validated by the first real dispatch. BUILD-9
  moved active→done; BUILD-10 (`ops/`) is next.

- **2026-07-02 — BUILD-8 DONE — build/release redesigned bridge-style (interactive; design at
  `docs/design/build_release_process.md`).** Requirements finalized with the user: organize the build the way
  `wb-mqtt-bridge` does. Two comparative maps showed we already share the tagging/GHCR/3-stage-lean-venv DNA
  (and are AHEAD on the analyzer-driven minimal deps + buildx caching), but diverge on organization: three
  disconnected workflows (an image can publish from a red tree), no CI ledger-guard, no `ops/` deploy story,
  gates inlined instead of the shared `py-dev-gates` action, one-target-per-dispatch (6 dispatches once EN
  lands). Decisions (all user-confirmed): one gated `ci.yml` with changes-filtering; **manual dispatch drives
  the full targets×languages matrix** gated on green health; **RU images keep unsuffixed names, EN adds
  `-en`**; **config-ui ships as a multi-arch nginx image** (`wb-mqtt-voice-ui`) but is not deployed to the
  controller yet; **`ops/` deploy-by-pull** with assets synced from a controller-side `git pull` (replaces the
  manual GHA-artifact download). **User hard requirement audited: model files are NOT baked into images** —
  runtime stages ship only code+venv, `/app/assets` is empty, models download at runtime; the one deliberate
  exception is the profile's spaCy NLU wheel, and the perceived image bulk is dependency weight (torch on
  standalone). Guards specified (empty-assets assertion + size budgets in the publish workflow). Stale
  `docker_build_review.md` annotated obsolete (pre-BUG-14 findings). BUILD-8 moved active→done; **BUILD-9**
  (ci.yml/matrix/guards/UI image) + **BUILD-10** (`ops/`) filed `[release]` per `design-then-implement`.

- **2026-07-02 — VWB-18 accepted + fixed bridge-side; cross-repo loop closed.** The bridge maintainer verified
  the QUAL-56-filed restart-durability triad against live code at intake (per their `cross-repo-source-of-truth`),
  confirmed all three findings, found one aggravation our review missed (boot persisted default device state
  *before* the restore stub ran — clobbering the last-good snapshot every boot), and fixed everything same day:
  `deactivate()` now clears the persisted `active_scenario` atomically (no restart resurrection), device state is
  restored at boot via a new `DevicePort.restore_state` seam (persist-without-restore rot closed — they chose
  *implement restore* over re-scoping the doc), and the toggle-power inversion closes as a consequence. Bridge
  suite 502 passing; their §7.1 doc overpromise corrected. Voice-side: review-index row + a one-time status
  pointer in `faf_durable_execution_review.md` updated (the frozen findings stand — they were verified correct).
  No voice-side scope change: VWB-18 was bridge-internal; TEST-17 still gates on VWB-15 (contract artifact),
  which remains open bridge-side.

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-61 + BUG-20 DONE — the durability arc closed with the cuts, and the gate run flushed out
  a real test-hermeticity bug.** **QUAL-61** (all three ARCH-27 D-7 cuts): the never-invoked retry machinery
  deleted from `handlers/base.py` (−98 LOC + the `max_retries`/`retry_delay` launch params); `AsyncTimerManager`
  deleted entirely (`core/timers.py` + engine/composition wiring — the durable store + reconciler IS the
  scheduler); the dead `inspect_active_action` path + its dataclasses trimmed from `debug_tools.py` (the live
  `/debug` status endpoint kept) and the never-read `NotificationMessage.retry_count`/`max_retries` fields
  removed. **BUG-20** (filed + fixed same day): the recurring `test_conversation_offline_degrades_gracefully`
  flake was NOT machine load — the "offline" smoke SUT inherited real LLM keys from the developer shell AND the
  repo `.env` (`load_dotenv()` in every runner), so the test made a **live DeepSeek call** that flaked on slow
  API responses; the ARCH-28 journal note's load hypothesis had causality backwards (the 59s suite runs were the
  slow-API runs). Fix: smoke fixtures launch the SUT with every `*_API_KEY` **blanked, not stripped** — dotenv
  never overrides an existing var, so empty beats both leak paths. Proof: smoke 6/6 in 12.5s truly offline, and
  the full suite dropped 24–59s → **~20s** (it had been calling DeepSeek every run). Gates: 1156 passed /
  7 skipped ×2 consecutive runs; pyright clean; lint-imports 10/10. Both moved active→done. **The QUAL-56
  durability arc is fully closed:** review → ARCH-27 design → BUG-19 → ARCH-28 substrate → QUAL-62 gate →
  QUAL-61 cuts. Journal rotated per `one-active-journal` (this file exceeded the ~1500-line high-water).

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-62 DONE — the ARCH-28 seam is now in the hexagon gate (user: "shouldn't we reflect it
  in our hexagon gate?").** New 10th import-linter contract *"Durable-action store is reached only through its
  seam (ARCH-28)"*: no application/delivery/adapter layer may import `irene.core.durable_actions`; the three
  sanctioned gateways (F&F choke point in `intents.handlers.base`, reconciler in `core.engine`, redelivery in
  `core.notifications`) are `ignore_imports` edges, so chains THROUGH the seam pass while any new direct import
  from an outer layer fails. The contract demonstrated it bites during introduction — it flagged the transitive
  `webapi_router → notifications → durable_actions` drain chain until the gateway edges were sanctioned. Design
  doc D-2 annotated with the gate. lint-imports 10/10 kept; contract test green. Filed + completed same day.

- **2026-07-02 — ARCH-28 DONE — durable-action substrate implemented (all 7 design slices, same-day as the
  design).** A timer is now literally restart-proof end-to-end: launch persists a schema-v1 intent record to
  `<assets_root>/state/durable_actions.json` (new `AssetConfig.state_root`, asset-managed + volume-mounted;
  atomic temp+rename writes; corrupt-file-safe), completion deletes it inside the done-callback, and
  `engine.start()` reconciles at boot — future deadlines re-arm via the handler's `rearm_durable_action` hook
  (timer relaunches with remaining time, reuses the persisted name, bumps its counter past it), deadlines missed
  ≤1h fire with a localized apology, older ones announce as expired. Completions flagged
  `redeliver_on_reconnect` survive an offline satellite: queued (TTL 1h, `created_at` preserved) and drained
  when `/ws/audio/reply` re-attaches. Failure notifications now announced by default (D-5). Read-only
  `/monitoring/actions` + `/monitoring/actions/history` shipped (contract regenerated, config-ui green).
  `client_registry.json` re-homed to `state/` with legacy `cache/` read-fallback (its registrations used to die
  with the container). Docs: `howto-new-intent.md` gained the "Long-running actions" authoring section, CLAUDE.md
  gained the **`durable-actions` invariant**, `client-registry.md` documents the durable twin (+ corrected its
  stale auto-expiry claim from QUAL-58). The restart test shipped WITH the substrate (12 tests in
  `test_durable_actions.py`) and immediately earned its keep: the reconciler's future-deadline-with-missing-
  handler branch mis-classified as fire-late and was fixed to announce-expired. Gates: 1156 passed / 7 skipped;
  pyright clean on 11 touched files; import-linter 9/9; openapi 108 paths + config-ui `check`/`build` green.
  _Note: `test_smoke_e2e.py::test_conversation_offline_degrades_gracefully` flaked twice under heavy machine
  load during this work (59s full-suite runs), passing in isolation and in two consecutive normal-load full
  runs — watched, not chased; file a task if it recurs._ QUAL-61 (cuts) is now fully unblocked. ARCH-28 moved
  active→done.

- **2026-07-02 — ARCH-27 DONE — durable-action substrate designed (interactive session, all decisions
  user-confirmed).** Recorded at `docs/design/durable_actions.md` (D-1…D-10 + the §3 handler-authoring
  contract). The decisions, both rounds: durability is an **explicit per-launch opt-in** (`durable=True`; timer
  is the only consumer today — confirmed — TTS/audio stay ephemeral); store = **atomic JSON file**
  (`cache/durable_actions.json`, temp+rename) behind a `DurableActionStorePort` (SQLite stays a drop-in swap);
  recovery = **re-arm by relaunch** through the normal launch path with the remaining duration (reconcile-by-diff,
  not log replay), missed deadlines **fire-with-apology** within a 1h grace window, expiry-announcement beyond it;
  **failures announced by default** (flip `critical_only`; sub-30s success suppression stays); redelivery of
  offline completions is a **handler-declared flag** (`redeliver_on_reconnect` — timer sets it; at-least-once for
  flagged, best-effort otherwise); the dead **retry machinery is cut** (QUAL-61 annotated UNBLOCKED — all three
  cuts confirmed, incl. `AsyncTimerManager`: the store + reconciler IS the scheduler); naming/identity rides
  BUG-19 (re-arm reuses the persisted action_name); observability = **minimal read-only**
  `/monitoring/actions[/history]`; rules bind via a new **`howto-new-intent.md` durability section +
  a `CLAUDE.md` `durable-actions` invariant**, both landing with the implementation. Bridge lessons baked in:
  delete-at-completion atomic with the in-memory clear (anti stale-intent resurrection), persist+restore+restart
  test ship together (anti persist-without-restore rot), ephemeral-field filter, shutdown discipline. Per
  `design-then-implement`: ARCH-27 moved active→done; **ARCH-28** filed (7 implementation slices, `[release]`).
  _Corrected same day (user review of the design): the store must live under the **asset-managed tree**, not
  `cache/` — new `<assets_root>/state/` folder (`AssetConfig.state_root`), because `assets_root`
  (`IRENE_ASSETS_ROOT`) is what's volume-mounted outside the Docker container; a redeploy must not wipe the
  records that exist to survive restarts, and `cache/` semantics (deletable) are wrong for durable state.
  Verification also surfaced that `client_registry.json` defaults to cwd-relative `cache/` (= `/app/cache`
  **inside** the container) — registrations already don't survive a container replacement; its relocation to
  `state/` (with old-path read-fallback) folded into ARCH-28 slice 1. D-2 + §4 amended._

- **2026-07-02 — BUG-19 DONE — F&F action-store correctness (the QUAL-56 fixes that don't wait for ARCH-27).**
  Four fixes: **(1)** audio/TTS action names are collision-proof (uuid suffix — same-millisecond launches used
  to collide), and the store is identity-safe: `remove_action(expected=)` guard means a displaced record's
  done-callback can no longer evict a live successor under the same key; `add_action` logs an error on live
  displacement. **(2)** The per-identity cap eviction now cancels the evicted task instead of leaving an
  untracked zombie. **(3)** Failure unmasking at the single choke point: the launch wraps every action coroutine
  with a falsy-return check — the handler `return True/False` convention was ignored, so TTS/audio coroutines
  that swallowed their own exceptions were recorded as SUCCESS; now `False` raises and the failure path runs
  (the two swallow blocks re-raise to keep the real error text). Centralized, so all 14 current bool-convention
  sites and every future handler inherit it. **(4)** Timeout is no longer indistinguishable from user
  cancellation: the monitor marks `ActionRecord.timed_out` before cancelling; history says `"timeout"` and
  metrics finally receive `timeout_occurred=True`. Gates: 1144 passed / 7 skipped (6 new regression tests; 1
  outdated test updated to the new raise contract); pyright clean on the 4 touched files. BUG-19 moved
  active→done. Next from QUAL-56: ARCH-27 (substrate design + handler rules), then QUAL-61 rides its
  keep-or-cut calls.

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-56 DONE — F&F durability critique + comparative bridge persistence analysis
  (user-requested).** Deliverable frozen at `docs/review/faf_durable_execution_review.md` (two parallel
  deep-reads: the F&F subsystem across 8 durability dimensions; how `../wb-mqtt-bridge` persists device state).
  **Verdict: zero on every durable-execution axis, by explicit design** — the action store is deliberately
  runtime-only, so a restart silently loses a 24h timer ("list timers" then denies it existed); delivery of
  deferred completions is at-most-once with five independent silent-drop points (incl. a preference gate that
  suppresses sub-30s completions and *all* non-critical failures by default); the retry machinery is dead config
  (`max_retries=0` everywhere); TTS/audio coroutines mask their own failures as success; name collisions can
  silently overwrite a *live* store record; `AsyncTimerManager` is instantiated-but-never-used dead capability.
  **Bridge comparison** sharpened the design brief: borrow its generic key→JSON SQLite store behind a hexagonal
  port, chokepoint dirty-write, ephemeral-field filter, and reconcile-by-diff restore — and design against its
  two demonstrated failure modes: persist-without-restore rot (device-state restore is still a logging stub) and
  the stale-intent key (deactivated scenario **resurrects on restart** and powers AV gear back on — filed to the
  bridge as **VWB-18**, left uncommitted per `cross-repo-source-of-truth`, with the restore-stub and
  toggle-inversion findings). **User scope statements recorded in the review:** durability is a platform
  requirement (future smart-home handlers), and the remedy = "a fix + rules for new handlers". Follow-ups filed
  accordingly: **ARCH-27** `[release]` (design: durable-action substrate at the F&F choke point + the
  handler-authoring durability rules, per `design-then-implement`), **BUG-19** `[release]` (collision-safe
  names + identity-safe add/remove, cancel-on-cap-evict, unmask TTS/audio failures, timeout≠cancel), **QUAL-61**
  `[deferred]` (dead-capability removal, gated on ARCH-27's keep-or-cut calls). QUAL-56 moved active→done.

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-59 DONE — capability drift fixed + dead code deleted (user directive: "I prefer dead code
  to be removed").** **(A6)** `/system/capabilities` now derives its provider/workflow lists from what is actually
  loaded (components' `providers` dicts + `workflow_manager.workflows`) instead of hardcoded lists that advertised
  the long-gone `continuous_listening` workflow and missed the `llm` NLU provider; regression test added.
  **(A7)** deleted outright rather than repaired: the entire dead Phase-3.5 action-management interface in
  `handlers/base.py` (7 zero-caller methods incl. the domain-keyed `cancel_all_actions`/`get_action_status` that
  would mis-cancel/double-record if ever wired — ~300 LOC, `base.py` 1350→1043 lines), the handler-side
  action-debugger wiring it existed for, the two `/intents/actions/*` REST stubs + their 3 orphaned schema
  classes, the zero-caller ContextManager introspection machinery (`get_context_for_intent_processing` +
  4 siblings incl. `cleanup_session`, which bypassed the BUG-16 metrics seam), and the 2 tests that only
  exercised deleted methods. Live-but-fragile code fixed instead: `nlu_component`'s cwd-dependent
  `Path("irene/...")`/`Path("assets")` are now package-relative. Because REST endpoints were removed, the
  committed contract was regenerated end-to-end: `scripts/dump_openapi.py` (106 paths) → config-ui
  `npm run gen:api-types` → `check` + `build` green (apiClient never used the stubs;
  `config-ui-stays-functional` upheld). Gates: 1138 passed / 7 skipped; pyright clean on all 7 touched files;
  import-linter 9/9 kept. QUAL-59 moved active→done — the QUAL-57 review's filed follow-ups are now ALL closed
  except QUAL-60 (deferred summarization enhancement).

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-58 DONE — memory-hygiene sweep (QUAL-57 M4–M8), all five items, user-requested same-day.**
  **(M4)** the resampling cache is now byte-bounded: 4 MB total budget + 1 MB per-entry bypass (full synthesized
  TTS replies are never cached — that was the tens-of-MB retention), FIFO on either bound, `cache_bytes` surfaced
  in stats. **(M5)** new `ClientRegistry.prune_stale_history()` drops per-identity completed-action history keys
  once their newest entry is an hour stale — the keysets grew monotonically with session-derived physical ids.
  **(M6)** the ContextManager cleanup loop now drives the registry's hygiene each cycle: `reap_dead_actions()`
  (the advertised layer-3 sweep finally has a runtime caller; the 4-layer docstring corrected) + the M5 prune.
  Judgment call: `cleanup_expired_clients` deliberately left manual — nothing refreshes `last_seen` during a
  live WS connection, so auto-expiry would unregister a live-but-quiet satellite mid-connection; documented in
  its docstring (the ledger text offered wire-or-document). **(M7)** `NotificationService` queue bounded
  (maxsize 1000; `put_nowait` + drop-with-warning so the F&F completion path never blocks) and
  `send_notification` lazily starts the processing loop — the consumer-less getter-minted-instance path is dead;
  the six provider `warm_up` preloads now hold their task refs (were GC-cancellable mid-model-load). **(M8)**
  the trace dir is rotated to the newest `MAX_TRACE_FILES = 500` on every save (each file embeds full base64
  audio); constant not config, same safety-net reasoning as BUG-17's cap. Gates: full suite 1139 passed /
  7 skipped (7 new tests in `test_memory_hygiene.py`; cache-stats shape test extended); pyright clean on all 11
  touched files; no user-facing doc describes any of these internals (checked); no config/REST shape change →
  config-ui untouched. QUAL-58 moved active→done. Of the QUAL-57 memory findings only QUAL-60 (deferred
  summarization enhancement) remains.

- **2026-07-02 — BUG-18 DONE — LLM conversation store bounded; `max_context_length` finally real (user chose
  "window now + file summarization").** The config key was read and never applied — the conversation handler's
  message store and domain threads grew per turn for the session's life, and every turn shipped the full history
  to the LLM. Now: `UnifiedConversationContext.trim_handler_messages` windows the store to the last
  `max_context_length` **turns** (×2 messages) with the seed system prompt pinned (reusing the
  `clear_handler_context(keep_system=True)` convention); `add_to_thread` gained a `max_messages` bound applied at
  both handler thread sites; the handler trims at both append seams — after the user append (before the LLM call,
  so the prompt is capped too) and after the assistant append. Config descriptions clarified (turns kept in the
  window) in `config/models.py` + `config-master.toml` — shape unchanged, config-ui `check` + `build` pass. Filed
  **QUAL-60** `[deferred]` for the summarize-then-truncate continuity enhancement (the trim call is the single
  choke point, so it slots in cleanly later). Gates: full suite 1132 passed / 7 skipped (4 new tests in
  `test_conversation_window.py`, incl. an 8-turn e2e proving the per-turn LLM prompt stops growing); pyright
  clean. BUG-18 moved active→done. All three QUAL-57 `[release]` memory findings are now fixed.

- **2026-07-02 — BUG-16 + BUG-17 DONE — the two high-severity QUAL-57 memory leaks fixed same-day (user: "fix
  BUG-16 and BUG-17 right away").** **BUG-16 (metrics session leak):** `record_session_end` now completes the
  session action under its real QUAL-9 key (`"session_{sid}:session"` — the old bare-domain check never matched)
  and **removes** the per-session `DomainMetrics` entry instead of retaining it forever; ended sessions leave a
  compact summary in a bounded `_recent_sessions` deque(100) + a lifetime counter; `get_session_analytics`
  active-check fixed to the real key and aggregates fold in the recent ring. Eviction now closes metrics through
  one seam: `ContextManager.remove_context` calls `record_session_end`, and the lazy sweep + `get_context` expiry
  both route through it (the sweep previously skipped metrics entirely). Side benefit: `current_concurrent_actions`
  is no longer permanently inflated by zombie session actions. **BUG-17 (`/ws/audio` unbounded batch buffer):**
  the batch-floor utterance loop is now capped at `WS_MAX_UTTERANCE_SECONDS = 60` (bytes derived from the
  registered sample rate); on overflow the utterance is **force-finalized** (processed, `metadata.overflow=true`,
  warning logged) and the loop continues — VAD-path max-duration semantics; a stuck client is bounded at ~1.9 MB
  instead of ~115 MB/h. Constant, not config, by design (safety net, not a tunable — avoids dragging
  CoreConfig/config-ui along). Gates: full suite 1128 passed / 7 skipped (incl. 8 new regression tests:
  `test_metrics_sessions.py`, 2 eviction-seam tests, 1 WS overflow e2e); pyright clean on the 3 touched files;
  `/monitoring/sessions` REST contract unchanged (built from system metrics) → config-ui unaffected;
  `dataflow.md` updated (`user-facing-docs-are-done`). Both moved active→done.

- **2026-07-02 — QUAL-57 DONE — general architecture review + memory-overconsumption audit (user-requested).**
  Deliverable frozen at `docs/review/arch_memory_review_2026-07-02.md`. Ran as 3 parallel deep-reads (architecture
  map / multi-turn memory / F&F re-verification + `create_task` census); the 3 headline memory findings were then
  spot-verified directly in code. Architecture verdict: top-quartile bones (enforced hexagonal layering with zero
  live violations, entry-point provider discovery, donation-driven NLU cascade, real streaming-ASR seam for ESP32),
  with the SOTA gaps at the interaction layer — no barge-in, whole-utterance TTS, no per-client concurrency
  isolation, weak session continuity (A1–A4, recorded for user decision). F&F: **all 10** QUAL-8 findings verified
  resolved by the QUAL-28 store redesign — the historically-worst memory offender is now clean. The live memory risk
  sits in the request path instead: filed **BUG-16** (metrics session leak — `record_session_end` key mismatch makes
  every REST call/WS connection permanently grow the singleton collector), **BUG-17** (`/ws/audio` batch floor
  accumulates PCM with no cap — ~115 MB/h per stuck client), **BUG-18** (LLM conversation store unbounded;
  `max_context_length` config is dead), plus **QUAL-58** (M4–M8 hygiene sweep) and **QUAL-59** (capability drift +
  dead Phase-3.5 code). A5 (in-memory action store, nothing survives restart) confirms QUAL-56's premise — that
  deferred task stands unchanged. Ledger: QUAL-57 moved active→done; review index row added.

- **ARCH-26 DONE — Irene↔bridge catalog contract settled (interactive design session).** Both questions decided with
  the user and recorded in `mqtt_integration.md` (banner + §5a/§8/§12/§13.3 + new **§14**). **(1)** Catalog refresh is
  **lazy** (startup pull + re-pull on a resolution/actuation miss) — Irene runs **no MQTT client**, does not subscribe
  to `bridge/catalog/version`, which resolves the §5a-vs-§8 contradiction in favour of no-MQTT; so "Irene never speaks
  MQTT" is now literally true, and the retained topic stays a bridge concern. **(2)** A committed, openapi-based
  **development contract artifact** (bridge `/openapi.json` = `CatalogResponse` + action-request body; a curated golden
  catalog "the works" + a real WB7 dump; canonical home **eval-commons**) plus a **bidirectional contract-testing seam**:
  the canonical `DeviceCommand` is the boundary, `{utterance → canonical}` crossover fixtures are the shared truth, Irene
  is the producer (via PR-1's capturing fake bridge = a new eval-commons `device_command` provider, text-first) and the
  bridge is the consumer — neither needs the other running. Filed **TEST-17** (contract bundle) + **TEST-18** (capture
  provider + producer tests) here; **VWB-15** (emit artifact) + **VWB-16** (consumer test) added to the `wb-mqtt-bridge`
  ledger (uncommitted there, per the user). ARCH-26 moved active→done; eval README "Future surfaces" updated.
  _Clarified same day (publish boundary): the bridge is the generator and commits its reference artifacts in the **bridge
  repo** — it does NOT write to eval-commons; TEST-17 owns the one-way pin into `eval-commons/contracts/`. Tightened §14,
  TEST-17, and VWB-15 so a bridge dev isn't left guessing where to publish._
- **ARCH-26 filed — two Irene↔bridge catalog-contract clarifications to settle before ARCH-8 PR-2.** A multi-agent MQTT
  status review surfaced a real design gap: `mqtt_integration.md` §5a/PR-2 have Irene *subscribe* to the retained MQTT
  topic `bridge/catalog/version`, while §8 asserts Flow 2 adds no MQTT dependency — contradictory (you can't subscribe
  with an HTTP client), and the bridge exposes the version hash only over that topic (no lightweight REST/SSE signal). So
  the earlier "Irene never speaks MQTT" framing is only true once this is decided (MQTT-subscribe vs REST-poll vs
  bridge-adds-a-cheap-signal). Bundled with a second, development-unblocking ask (user-requested): a committed
  **openapi.json-style catalog contract artifact** — a JSON Schema of the `/system/catalog` response + a sample dump,
  shared cross-project — so Irene's PR-1/PR-3 can build the `DeviceCatalog`/resolver against a concrete contract with no
  live bridge. Design task (deliverable = an `mqtt_integration.md` edit + filed follow-ups); `[deferred]` to match the
  P-TBD parent ARCH-8. Registered in the design index against `mqtt_integration.md`.
- **BUG-15 DONE — AssetManager no longer wedges on a partial download (filed + fixed on request).** The I18N-8 note
  became a task: `download_model` trusted `model_path.exists()` as "download complete", so an interrupted/failed
  extraction left a broken-but-present pack that was never re-downloaded (the empty `piper/amy` + `piper/irina` dirs that
  failed Piper warm-up). Fixed both roots in `irene/core/assets.py`: (1) extraction now **stages into
  `.<name>.incomplete` and renames into place only on success** (was: unpacked straight into the final path, and the
  `except` cleaned only the archive) — so a failure never leaves a partial; (2) the cache check skips only a **populated**
  path (`_is_populated_download`: non-empty file, or dir with ≥1 file), clearing an empty/partial one and re-downloading.
  `download_model_pack` already validated members, so it was fine. 4 regression tests in `test_asset_extract.py`. Gates:
  pyright 0, suite 1120, import-linter 9/9. Tagged `[release]` (any interrupted first-boot download on a satellite would
  otherwise wedge a model).
- **I18N-8 DONE — English eval suite green end-to-end (+ a base-provider runtime fix it exposed).** Brought up
  `embedded-armv7-en` locally (Moonshine downloaded + extracted cleanly — the `_bz2` venv fix proven in the real asset
  path) and ran the English suites: **`make ws CONFIG=embedded-armv7-en` = 4/4** (Moonshine WER ✓ + intent ✓ +
  DeepSeek-UX ✓) and recorded **`traces/en/timer_set_10min.json`** — an *audio-input* golden captured from the live run
  (so `make replay` re-runs the real ASR, a stronger regression than the ru text-golden) → **`make replay
  CONFIG=embedded-armv7-en` = 1/1** (offline, matches oracle). **The first component-level EN run exposed a real bug:** the
  base sherpa `is_available()` hardcoded the `sherpa_onnx` asset namespace, so the ASR component evaluated the
  `sherpa_moonshine` subclass under the wrong namespace, judged it "not available (dependencies missing)", and dropped it
  — `/ws/audio` then rejected every fixture with `asr_required_for_audio` (0/4). Fixed at the base (altitude): key
  `is_available()` + `download_model_pack()` on `get_provider_name()` so any subclass resolves its own namespace
  (behavior-preserving for the base, whose name *is* `sherpa_onnx`); added a regression test. This means I18N-2's
  "end-to-end" validation had only exercised the provider directly, not through the ASR component gate — I18N-8 is where
  the true integration closed. Also verified the full EN stack boots clean incl. Piper `amy` TTS (an earlier amy warm-up
  error was a **stale pre-`_bz2` empty model dir** that `AssetManager`'s existence check skipped re-downloading; cleared
  amy + irina, both re-download fine). Gates: pyright 0, suite **1116** (+1 regression), import-linter 9/9. The
  dir-existence fragility this surfaced (re-using a broken partial after an interrupted extraction) is now **BUG-15**.
- **Doc + dev-env follow-ups to BUG-14 (no repo behavior change).** (1) Annotated the stale
  `docs/design/onnx_inference_layer.md` §4 — its `sherpa-onnx==1.10.46` armv7 pin was **superseded** by BUG-14 (the
  ELF-alignment failure is now patched in-build via `patch_onnx_align.py` + bookworm base; pin is **1.12.36**). Added a
  supersession banner + inline notes on the two live-reading pin recommendations, pointing to `multilingual_deployment.md`
  §2d and the Dockerfile.armv7 header. (2) Confirmed the user-facing `docs/guides/build-docker.md` needs **no** change —
  it abstracts above the base OS / onnxruntime, and BUG-14's patch runs in the *builder* stage so "nothing build-only is
  left behind" still holds. (3) Rebased the local dev `.venv` off the source-built `/usr/local` Python 3.11.4 (compiled
  **without `_bz2`** → `.tar.bz2` model extraction failed locally, though deployment images are fine) onto uv-managed
  **cpython-3.11.12** (`_bz2` present); identical 204-dep closure, both editables (irene + eval-commons) restored, suite
  **1115 passed / 7 skipped** (2 formerly-skipped bz2-gated tests now run). Unblocks a fully-local I18N-8 run.
- **I18N-2 DONE — offline Moonshine wired as the armv7 English ASR (subclass, end-to-end validated).** Implemented
  **`SherpaMoonshineASRProvider(SherpaOnnxASRProvider)`** (`irene/providers/asr/sherpa_moonshine.py`, entry point
  `sherpa_moonshine`) for `sherpa-onnx-moonshine-tiny-en-quantized-2026-02-27` (43 MB merged `.ort`, English-only,
  offline). Subclass (not a base `model_type`) because Moonshine diverges from the VOSK/Whisper families on all three
  axes the base assumes shared: **distribution** — a k2-fsa GitHub `.tar.bz2` via `AssetManager.download_model`
  (URL+extract, like Piper voices), not an HF model-pack; **pack shape** — merged `encoder_model.ort` +
  `decoder_model_merged.ort` + `tokens.txt` (resolved recursively); **construction** — the merged decoder isn't exposed
  by `OfflineRecognizer.from_moonshine()`, so the recognizer is built directly from `OfflineMoonshineModelConfig(…,
  merged_decoder=…)` using the internal `_Recognizer` grabbed from the factory's globals (version-agnostic). Mirrors
  `piper_ruaccent ⊂ piper`. Everything else inherits — crucially the **offline** path (`supports_streaming` False →
  `/ws/audio` batch branch → **dodges BUG-13**, the streaming-head-drop that sank the original zipformer pick). Swapped
  `configs/embedded-armv7-en.toml` ASR to `sherpa_moonshine` and **retired** the rejected `zipformer-en-20M` catalog
  entry in `sherpa_onnx.py` (kept the `zipformer-streaming` model_type as a generic online-transducer alias). The
  dynamic sherpa construction is annotated against `Any` (its Python objects are built at import and the merged-decoder
  path isn't in the typed API) — honest imports, no `# type: ignore`. **Validated end-to-end on x86_64** (sherpa
  1.13.2): both real recorded fixtures transcribe cleanly (`light_unreachable`, `timer_10min`). Gates: pyright 0,
  config-validator ✓, suite **1113** (+3 new Moonshine unit tests), import-linter 9/9. Unblocked by BUG-14 (bookworm +
  p_align patch + sherpa 1.12.36, proven on the WB7). Remaining follow-up **I18N-8** — a green English `make ws` — needs
  a bz2-capable env for the `.tar.bz2` extraction (the dev `.venv` Python lacks `libbz2`, the same gap that blocks Piper
  amy locally; the WB7/Docker image has it).
- **BUG-14 DONE — armv7 Docker fixed to run sherpa 1.12.36 + Moonshine (proven on the WB7).** Implemented the
  user-approved "build the libs in Docker" fix in `docker/Dockerfile.armv7`: base bullseye→**bookworm** (for
  GLIBCXX_3.4.30, which sherpa ≥1.12's C++ module needs; +4.4 MB on the WB7), a new **`docker/patch_onnx_align.py`** step
  that rewrites the bundled onnxruntime `.so` `PT_LOAD` `p_align` 64K→4K (the ELF-alignment fix; verified: patches the
  armv7 `.so`, idempotent, safe no-op on 64-bit / non-ONNX configs), and bumped the armv7 sherpa pin **1.10.46→1.12.36**
  (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` — scoped: only sherpa armv7 changed, 64-bit stays 1.13.3). One pin serves **both** RU
  (vosk `from_transducer`, API-compatible) and EN (Moonshine merged `.ort`) — the ru/en split needs no per-config build
  machinery, `CONFIG_PROFILE` already drives the analyzer. **Proven end-to-end on the WB7** (root@192.168.110.250): patched
  sherpa 1.12.36 on bookworm imports and runs Moonshine — RTF ~0.7 (faster than RU vosk's 1.15), 134 MB RSS, both
  fixtures perfect. Also reconciled the "proven on hardware" claim (§4 pinned 1.10.46 for this exact ELF issue — I'd
  tested the wrong versions). Unblocks **I18N-2** (wire the Moonshine subclass). Config-validator green; the full
  `docker buildx build` of the armv7 image stays a deploy checkpoint (untested even before, per §4.7). WB7 left clean.
- **WB7 on-hardware test → BUG-14 filed; Moonshine is the armv7 English ASR, gated on an onnxruntime build.** SSH'd to
  the WB7 (root@192.168.110.250) and ran Moonshine in the deployment-base container. Found `import sherpa_onnx` fails at
  the native lib — `libonnxruntime.so: ELF load command address/offset not properly aligned` — for sherpa 1.13.2 (PyPI)
  **and** 1.12.36 (PiWheels), on the host py3.9 (cp39) **and** a py3.11 container (cp311). Digging into the "proven on
  hardware" evidence reconciled it: `onnx_inference_layer.md` §4 **already documented this** and pinned
  `sherpa-onnx==1.10.46` (applied at `pyproject.toml:59`) — I'd tested the wrong versions. But 1.10.46 has **no**
  `OfflineMoonshineModelConfig`, and the merged Moonshine needs sherpa ≥1.12 → a version pincer. Filed **BUG-14** (the
  onnxruntime armv7 alignment defect, now load-bearing for English). **User decision:** this does not block Moonshine —
  build the corrected onnxruntime in the armv7 Docker (patchelf/rebuild) + bump the pin. So the ledger now reads:
  **armv7 English ASR = Moonshine (chosen), sequence BUG-14 → I18N-2.** WB7 left clean (workdir removed, no new
  containers/images — all reused/`--rm`). aarch64/x86_64 unaffected.
- **I18N-2 leading candidate = `moonshine-tiny-en-quantized-2026-02-27` (offline, 43 MB); WER `ten`/`10` fix applied.**
  ChatGPT surfaced a newer Moonshine build; verified it: it's the *merged-`.ort`* quantized export at **43 MB** (not the
  123 MB `-int8` that was rejected), offline (no head-drop), **loads on our sherpa-onnx 1.13.2 with no bump** (merged
  decoder via `OfflineMoonshineModelConfig(encoder=, merged_decoder=)`, since `from_moonshine` doesn't expose it), and
  transcribes the real recorded fixtures cleanly (a slower re-record of the timer fixed the earlier fast-speech miss —
  pace, not the model). `linux_armv7l` wheels ship; offline → batch → dodges BUG-13. Distributed as a k2-fsa GitHub
  `.tar.bz2` (not HF), so it uses the URL+extract download path. **Planned wiring: a subclass**
  `SherpaMoonshineASRProvider(SherpaOnnxASRProvider)` (mirrors `piper_ruaccent ⊂ piper`) to isolate the tarball
  download + merged-decoder construction; the base stays clean. Recorded as the I18N-2 leading candidate (design §2d).
  Applied the `ten`/`10` fix in eval-commons `wer_scorer` (`a7b8a1e`: fold English number-words to digits) — the timer
  case now scores 0.000. **Only open gate: on-device armv7 runtime/RAM on the WB7** (currently unreachable).
- **I18N-2 REOPENED + BUG-13 filed — the first real English `make ws` exposed that zipformer-en-20M is unusable.** The
  recorded English fixtures (I18N-8) are good (offline Moonshine transcribed them, one perfectly), but `make ws
  CONFIG=embedded-armv7-en` came back 4/4 TimeoutError. Diagnosis: `zipformer-en-20M` (the I18N-2 pick) is a **streaming**
  (online) transducer — it **drops the utterance head** on bounded commands ("set a timer for ten minutes" → `''`;
  "turn on the light in the garage" → `"T IN THE GARRAGE"`), and it routes `/ws/audio` into a streaming branch that
  **hangs** for bounded delivery (no partial/response, 30 s timeout). RU works because vosk-small-ru is **offline**
  (whole-buffer). The I18N-2 spike scored zipformer on clean LibriSpeech clips (lead-in silence), which masked the
  head-drop — the lesson is to benchmark on the actual utterance shape, not corpus clips. **Reopened I18N-2** for a
  small OFFLINE arm32 English ASR (**Moonshine rejected — 124 MB too big**, per user); **filed BUG-13** for the
  streaming-branch hang. aarch64/x86_64 English is unaffected (Whisper is offline). The English harness + rubrics remain
  proven; the suite can be greened on an offline 64-bit config meanwhile. Committed the validated `fixtures/en/*`.
- **Recorder made language-aware (enables I18N-8).** The fixture recorder read raw YAML, so the bilingual ws config
  broke it two ways: `fixtures/{{env.EVAL_LANG}}/…` stayed literal and the ru+en cases collided on the fixture key with
  different reference text (spurious conflict) — a gap in the I18N-5 harness (I'd validated the eval run, not the record
  path). Fixed in eval-commons `629fb8d`: `resolve_worklist(yaml, language=)` filters by `metadata.language` (`EVAL_LANG`)
  and resolves `{{env.VAR}}` in the audio path. Verified: `make record-list EVAL_LANG=en` lists the two `fixtures/en/*`
  with English prompts; `=ru` lists the existing ones. 5 recorder tests green. `make record EVAL_LANG=en` now works.
- **I18N-5 closed as DONE (harness); English audio recording split to I18N-8.** The harness is a complete, committed,
  validated unit, so it moves to the done ledger; the one mic-dependent remainder (record `fixtures/en/*` + a `traces/en/`
  golden) is now its own task **I18N-8** rather than a long-lived partial. No code change — a ledger split for accuracy.
- **I18N-5 (harness DONE) — bilingual eval; only mic-recorded English audio remains.** Built the multilingual eval
  harness and verified it end-to-end. Design decision (user-confirmed): **fixtures/traces partitioned by language
  subdirectory** (`fixtures/<lang>/`, `traces/<lang>/`) — same scenario filenames across languages so parity is a
  directory diff; moved the Russian assets into `ru/`. Added an **`EVAL_LANG`** axis to `eval/Makefile` (default `ru`,
  derived from the `*-en` CONFIG name; deliberately *not* `LANG`, which is the POSIX locale var), driving the fixture/
  trace subdir (`{{env.EVAL_LANG}}`) + `--filter-metadata language=$(EVAL_LANG)` (promptfoo ANDs it with `kind=ux`), plus
  an `EVAL_ROOM` (Кухня/Kitchen) since the room name is echoed in the failure reply. Cases are duplicated per language and
  tagged `metadata.language`; added EN config profiles and **EN rubrics** `shared/rubrics/en-ux.yaml` (co-equal, mirroring
  the TEST-16 structure). **Validated:** RU suite green under the new layout (`make ws CONFIG=embedded-armv7` = 4/4), and
  the EN rubrics scored **7/7** live against DeepSeek (pass genuine English; fail Russian/error/rude/non-confirmation) —
  first-try clean, consistent with DeepSeek's better English. Also migrated the RU ws cases to the co-equal rubrics
  (closes the TEST-16 loop) and fixed a stale `voice` config ref in `eval/README`. **Only remaining:** record
  `fixtures/en/*` + a `traces/en/` golden (needs a mic). The English stack is otherwise complete and runnable.
- **I18N-6 DONE — English donation audit: functional parity, no fill needed.** Compared `en.json` vs `ru.json` across
  all 13 handlers (structure, phrase coverage, examples/patterns). Result: full structural parity (identical methods +
  parameters, no stubs) and adequate idiomatic English phrases throughout. The only systematic difference is empty
  English lemmas — and that's correct, not a gap: lemmas are *additive* matcher keywords, Russian needs them for its
  heavy inflection (roots like `поставить`/`таймер`), English carries base forms in multi-word phrases and leans on
  fuzzy matching; single-word English lemmas (`set`/`stop`/`time`) would over-match and hurt precision. Closed as
  audit-only (user-confirmed) — no donation changes. This completes the buildable English stack (I18N-2/3/4/6/7);
  I18N-5 (English eval + fixtures) is the last open slice.
- **I18N-4 DONE — English deployment configs for all three arches; RU configs made explicitly RU-only.** Added
  `configs/{embedded-armv7,embedded-aarch64,standalone-x86_64}-en.toml` as full copies of their Russian counterparts
  with only the language-bearing fields swapped: armv7 → `zipformer-en-20M`/`zipformer-streaming` + Piper `amy`; aarch64
  → `whisper-small` (multilingual, config-only) + plain Piper `amy` (`piper_ruaccent` disabled); standalone →
  torch-whisper (config-only) + `silero_v3 v3_en` (`put_accent`/`put_yo` off), wake word already `hey_jarvis`. Each sets
  `default_language`/`supported_languages`=en at the top level, `[asr]` + `[asr.providers.*].default_language=en`,
  `auto_detect_language=false`, workflow + keyword-matcher language. **Symmetry (user-raised):** the three RU configs
  were implicitly bilingual (legacy `language="ru"` only → schema-default `supported_languages=["ru","en"]` +
  auto-detect on, which only ever changed the reply *string*, never ASR/TTS); they now declare `default_language="ru"` +
  `supported_languages=["ru"]` + `auto_detect_language=false` — one honest language per config, parallel to the `-en`
  files. `config-master.toml` stays the comprehensive `["ru","en"]` reference. Added an English worked-example pointer
  to `docs/guides/howto-new-language.md`. Gates: config-validator ✓ (12 configs), suite 1110, pyright 0. No schema
  change (config-ui unaffected). Remaining I18N: I18N-5 (EN eval + fixtures), I18N-6 (`en.json` donation audit).
- **I18N-3 + I18N-7 DONE — English TTS on all three arches (Piper on the satellites, Silero v3 on the standalone).**
  I18N-3: generalized the `ru_RU`-hardcoded Piper catalog to a locale param and added `en_US-amy`(default)/`lessac`/`ryan`
  — same `.tar.bz2` packs + sherpa runtime, no provider change; capabilities now report per-instance language so
  `piper_ruaccent` (always RU) stays RU. I18N-7: adjusted the *existing* `silero_v3` provider (not a new one) to pull
  speakers/accent/language **by model** — `v3_en` → `en_0…en_117`, default-speaker fallback, and the Russian
  `put_accent`/`put_yo` omitted for non-RU models (verified via real `v3_en` synthesis: 57 MB `.pt`, 119 speakers,
  `apply_tts(en_0)` clean — and put_accent turned out to be *accepted* by v3_en, so the guard is about semantics, not
  crashes; comment corrected). Gates: pyright 0, suite **1107**, import-linter 9/9. Both TTS tasks were hardware-
  independent and are fully done; the EN *configs* that wire these (I18N-4) and EN fixtures/eval (I18N-5) remain.
- **I18N-2 DONE — armv7 English ASR = `zipformer-en-20M` (measured, not guessed).** Downloaded both candidates and ran
  them locally on a shared LibriSpeech clip set (WER is architecture-independent, so the head-to-head is valid off the
  WB7): `zipformer-en-20M` = 43.6 MB int8, WER 0.091, streaming, proven `linux_armv7l`, ~zero code delta (reuses the
  existing online-transducer path); `moonshine-tiny-en` = 123.5 MB int8 (~3×), WER 0.030, offline, arm32 unproven, new
  `from_moonshine` branch. Moonshine is more accurate but **has no home** — too big/unproven for the armv7 tier,
  redundant with multilingual Whisper on the 64-bit arches — so zipformer wins the *slim + arm32-proven + torch-free*
  WB7 slot (small-model WER is the same accuracy-for-size trade `vosk-small-ru` makes for Russian). Wired: catalog
  `zipformer-en-20M` + `model_type="zipformer-streaming"` + language-derived `get_supported_languages` in
  `irene/providers/asr/sherpa_onnx.py`; streaming-alias test updated. Gates: pyright 0, suite 1105, import-linter 9/9,
  config-validator 100%. Residual on-WB7 RAM/latency folded into I18N-4; real English WER rides with I18N-5 fixtures.
- **I18N design refinement — standalone TTS is torch Silero, not Piper; Silero English caps at `v3_en`.** Corrected an
  over-unification in the I18N-1 design: TTS is per-architecture (Piper on the two torch-free satellites; the x86_64
  standalone runs `silero_v4` torch for Russian). The authoritative Silero `models.yml` shows Russian advanced
  `v3→v4→v5` but **English never left `v3`** (no `v4_en`/`v5_en`; confirmed at `silero_v4.py:54`). Decision (user):
  keep **torch parity** on the standalone with **`silero_v3 v3_en`** — same `.pt` size, one quality tier below RU
  `v4_ru`, accepted to avoid pulling the sherpa-onnx runtime into the torch image. The `silero_v3` provider already
  exists and already lists `v3_en` — the work is an *adjustment* (pull model + speakers by language), filed as
  **I18N-7**; I18N-3 (Piper) is now scoped to the satellites, and I18N-4 points the standalone config at `silero_v3`.
- **I18N-1 (design) — real English deployment: slim cross-arch model set + one-bulk-per-language eval.** Three
  read-only investigations settled the architecture question raised while adding EN UX rubrics: language auto-detection
  is wired only to text-understanding + response strings, **not** ASR/TTS (`switch_language` is a TODO stub;
  `persist_language_preference` + `[nlu_analysis.languages]` are dead config) — so the voice pipeline is **monolingual
  per config**, and language is a per-deployment choice, not a runtime switch (staying slim, as intended). The config
  language flag drives the text side automatically but ASR/TTS model paths are independent per-provider fields. **Model
  finding (web-sourced):** sherpa-onnx (ASR) + Piper (TTS) already span all three Docker arches torch-free with English
  models size-matched to the Russian stack — only **one new ASR asset** is genuinely required (armv7), because whisper is
  multilingual on 64-bit (config-only) and English Piper voices are the *same* k2-fsa `.tar.bz2` medium packs (a catalog
  generalization, not the "TTS blocker" it first looked like). armv7 EN ASR is a measured spike:
  `sherpa-onnx-streaming-zipformer-en-20M` (43.6 MB int8, proven arm32, streaming) vs `moonshine-tiny-en` (English-only,
  offline, better WER than whisper-tiny, arm32 unconfirmed). EN Piper voice = `amy`. Design →
  `docs/design/multilingual_deployment.md`; filed implementation slices I18N-2/3/4/5/6 (ASR spike, Piper catalog,
  `*-en.toml` configs, EN eval `LANG` axis + rubrics + fixtures, `en.json` donation audit). No code shipped.
- **TEST-16 (partial) — calibrated the DeepSeek Russian UX judge; hardened the shared rubrics.** The live UX suite's
  two cases are both expected-PASS happy paths, so they can't tell a working judge from one that rubber-stamps. A
  12-case balanced probe (both classes, run through the *same* `llm-rubric`→DeepSeek path, in scratchpad) showed the
  judge is **deterministic at temp 0** (stable across 4 runs) but **PASS-biased** — every disagreement was a
  false-accept, including an all-English graceful-failure reply passing. Fix attempt #1 (an emphatic "оцени как НЕ
  пройдено, если ответ не на русском" *override*) fixed English but **regressed the tone check** — the rude reply
  flipped FAIL→PASS (verified stable under both old and new rubric, so a real rubric side-effect, not variance): the
  override hijacked the judge's attention. Fix #2 (shipped) restructures `confirms_action_ru` + `graceful_failure_ru`
  in `../eval-commons/shared/rubrics/ru-ux.yaml` into **co-equal numbered conditions** (language is one condition among
  several, not an override) → probe agreement 83%→92%, `graceful_failure` 6/6, 0 false-rejects, 1 residual borderline
  false-accept. **Lesson:** happy-path-only judge suites are blind to the judge's dominant failure mode (leniency), and
  patching one rubric criterion can silently degrade another — re-measure ALL cases after any rubric edit. Full
  calibration (human/Russian-speaker gold labels, more negatives, Cohen's κ, propagate the rubrics into the live
  suite) stays open under TEST-16; the probe stays in scratchpad (not committed).
- **TEST-15 DONE — WS suite now scores ASR/WER, and the whole `make ws` is green live (WER + intent + UX).** The
  ledger assumed the SUT had to be changed to expose the recognized transcript; a live probe flipped that
  (`task-start-reconciliation`): the SUT **already** surfaces it at `metadata.audio_processing.transcribed_text` on the
  batch path (`_process_single_audio_pipeline` writes it, `/ws/audio` forwards it in `_meta`), matching the spoken
  reference exactly. User-confirmed approach = **eval-side only, no SUT change**: `ws_audio_provider` (in
  `../eval-commons`) now resolves the transcript in priority order — `metadata.audio_processing.transcribed_text` →
  last streaming `partial` → reply text — so WER scores the *recognized speech*, not the reply. Verified live vs
  `configs/embedded-armv7` with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set: `make ws TARGET=local` = **4/4 pass** (WER 0 on «поставь таймер
  на десять минут»; intent `timer.set`; both DeepSeek-judged UX cases pass — 726 grading tokens confirm the judge ran),
  `make cli` still 5/5. Cleared the now-confirmed intent-name + unreachable-device TODOs in `ws.promptfooconfig.yaml`;
  refreshed `eval/README`. **Lesson:** reconcile against the *code*, not just the task text — the "missing" contract was
  already there; the only gap was the harness not reading it. Closes the trace-driven system-testing slices
  (TEST-12/13/14/15). DeepSeek Russian-judge *calibration* stays advisory (a standing UX-tier caveat, not a task).
- **BUG-12 DONE — the `make ws` "SUT failure" was promptfoo's response cache, not a hang/provider/SUT bug.** Chasing
  the apparent hang: it wasn't a hang (my Bash timeout) and the eval-commons `ws_audio_provider` is correct (`call_api`
  succeeds directly). The real cause: an early `make ws` against a mis-launched SUT cached "ASR provider 'whisper' not
  available" per fixture in `~/.promptfoo/cache`, and every later run **replayed the cached failure without contacting
  `:6000`** — the SUT log showed zero `/ws/audio` requests, while `PROMPTFOO_CACHE_ENABLED=false` made the same run hit
  the live SUT (sherpa_onnx) and return «Таймер установлен на 10 мин». Fix: `eval/Makefile` now exports
  `PROMPTFOO_CACHE_ENABLED := false` (every surface here is a live test — caching can only mask reality) + cleared the
  poisoned cache. Verified: plain `make ws` runs live, ASR case passes, intent confirms `timer.set`; `make cli` still
  5/5. Filed **TEST-15** for the WER-vs-reply-text gap (offline ASR emits no partials, so the provider returns reply
  text — WER needs the SUT to surface the recognized transcript in metadata). UX still needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
  **Lesson:** a test harness that caches *live* tests is a footgun — a transient failure poisons every later run and
  reads as a persistent SUT bug. The user's "isn't the ws port different?" reframed it to "the request never reaches the
  SUT," which pointed straight at the cache.
- **BUG-11 DONE — the WS e2e "whisper" error was a broken config, not a `/ws/audio` provider bug.** Deep research
  (static-map agent + live instrumented repro) **disproved** the original hypothesis: a clean `embedded-armv7` SUT
  transcribes the recording correctly via `sherpa_onnx` (verified «Таймер установлен на 10 мин» success:true). The error
  came from running `voice.toml` — `[asr] default_provider="whisper"` with no `[asr.providers.whisper]` → zero providers
  → every request failed (the CR-A2 reconcile only fires when providers is non-empty). User-approved fixes: **(B)**
  deleted the 4 stale broken configs (voice/minimal/development/api-only) + repointed every ref (test→full,
  build_analyzer/validator/cli-test, eval Makefile/profile, QUICKSTART rewritten to copy config-master + toggle
  components, 3 guides, issue template, env-example, build-system diagram regenerated); **(A)** asr_component raises at
  init on enabled-but-zero-providers (was a silent warning → per-request 404s); **(C)** eval WS default config voice →
  embedded-armv7; **(D)** schema ASR default "whisper"/["whisper"] → ""/[] to match the runtime ASRConfig. Configs 13→9.
  Gates: pyright 0, config-validator 9/9, suite 1105, import-linter 9/9; armv7 re-verified. **Lesson:** the recordings +
  harness were vindicated — the system test did its job (surfaced a real config-robustness gap), and a stale-process
  artifact (my own `pkill -f irene-webapi` self-kill) muddied the early diagnosis. _Open: the promptfoo `make ws` run
  hangs where a direct WS client succeeds — a harness-level follow-up before WS is green e2e._
- **UI-14 DONE — config-ui §E completed: efficiency + E6 drift-guard done; E7/E9/E10 → UI-16; E8 non-issue.** Added the
  altitude half: E6 makes the `ContractEditor` enum dropdowns derive from `satisfies Record<Union,…>` keys, so a backend
  donation-enum change fails the build rather than silently dropping options (a TS union can't be enumerated at runtime,
  so a compile-time exhaustiveness guard is the right fix). Assessing the rest surfaced (UI-12-style) that §E's altitude
  items were partly over-credited: E7 (component roster) + E9 (widget heuristics) need backend schema metadata that
  doesn't exist (`is_component`/`widget` hints) → spun out as **UI-16**; E10 (spaCy-attr i18n) is niche → UI-16; E8
  (language labels/fallback) is a non-issue (display names are inherently UI; the `['en','ru']` fallback is defensible).
  Gate: config-ui check + build green.
- **UI-14 efficiency half DONE — config-ui perf fixes (behavior-preserving).** E1 derived `hasChanges` (removed the
  state-via-effect + the redundant `setHasChanges(false)` calls on the Templates/Prompts pages — verified each
  coincided with `data===original`, so equivalent); E2 `TomlPreview` debounce moved to a `useRef` (no re-render per
  keystroke); E3 all 14 `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)` deep-copies → `structuredClone`; E5 memoized LemmasEditor's
  nested-loop suggestion scan + a per-row conflict map. **E4 skipped** (threading the memoized hash risks a cache-key
  mismatch on the manual-analyze path — minor perf, real risk). Gate: config-ui check + build green. UI-14 stays open
  `[~]`; the hardcoded-list/altitude half (E6–E10) is UX-touching / backend-contract-coupled — left as a separate call.
- **UI-13 DONE — config-ui dead-export removal (the clean one).** Verified 0 external refs for each (ESLint flags only
  unused *locals*; type-check would catch a mis-call), then deleted: 8 utility aliases (`types/index.ts`), 8 dead
  interfaces (`types/components.ts`, 239→174), `validateSpacyAttribute`, `wouldShowObjectObject`. Folded in: the 12
  hand-written `*Request` types in `api.ts` that C1 orphaned (the same-named `openapi.gen.ts` schemas are generated/
  separate), and the unused `ajv`/`ajv-formats` deps (UI-11 §B finding; `npm uninstall`). Gate green (check + build),
  confirming all dead. Contrast with UI-12: unlike presentation-coupled "duplication", dead exports ARE cleanly
  removable — verify-then-delete, gate-caught.
- **UI-12 DONE — config-ui duplication consolidation: the 2 clean dedups done, C2–C5 assessed-declined.** **C1** (apiClient
  per-language CRUD quintet → 6 shared helpers + thin typed wrappers, `123ce3b`) and **C6** (decompile scaffold →
  `useDecompiledPatterns` hook, `99c1432`) — ~280 lines genuinely removed, type-proven & behavior-preserving. Pushing
  into C2–C5 (per user's push-through choice) **surfaced that review §C over-credited them**: the pages/editors are
  same-concept-divergent-presentation, not clones (C2 ~10 page behaviors, many intentional; C3 Lemmas' per-row conflict
  badges + Spacy's index/styling; C4/C5 Template already uses ArrayOfStringsEditor + read-only keys vs Localization's
  type-switch/domain-hints) — merging changes UX, so assessed & declined (annotated in the review doc; user closed).
  Lesson: the config-ui "duplication" that's truly faithful is the pure-logic/byte-identical kind (C1/C6); concept-level
  similarity in presentation-coupled React components is not safely auto-dedup-able. Gate: config-ui check + build green.
- **UI-11 DONE — config-ui type-contract drift realigned (restores the type-check gate).** `src/types/api.ts` (what
  `apiClient` consumes) had fallen behind backend `CoreConfig` while the generated `openapi.gen.ts` sat current-but-
  unused. Realigned the 4 drifted types to the backend (verified vs the gen file + `models.py`): added `outputs`/`trace`
  + canonical `default_language`/`supported_languages` to CoreConfig, removed the phantom NLU language fields, rewrote
  VADConfig to the ARCH-18 shape (per-engine knobs now under `providers`). Zero consumer churn (no component read any
  drifted field — pure type-accuracy), so `config-ui-stays-functional`'s type-check no longer passes on false types.
  Gate: config-ui `check` + `build` green. Durable follow-up (derive `api.ts` from the generated schema) noted but left
  as a larger structural call. Review cleanup remaining: UI-12 (dup) / UI-13 (dead) / UI-14 (efficiency) / UI-15 (feature).
- **BUG-10 DONE — config-ui blocking-conflicts dialog made reachable (read-only).** Blocking conflicts disable Apply, so
  the dialog's only opener (a branch inside the disabled handler) could never fire. Added a "Review blocking conflicts"
  trigger that opens it read-only (dropped the `console.log` `onResolve` stub → no dead Resolve buttons), removed the
  unreachable branch, +i18n (en/ru). User triaged to **build real resolution** → filed **UI-15** (design-then-implement);
  this is the foundation it builds on. Gate: config-ui `check` + `build` green. Closes the review's correctness cluster
  (BUG-8/9/10); cleanup UI-11..14 + feature UI-15 remain.
- **BUG-9 DONE — config-ui real-time analysis stale-request overwrite.** The post-await guard read the abort signal off
  the ref (newest controller), so a slow earlier response clobbered newer conflicts; fixed by guarding on a
  per-invocation local `AbortController` (the ref still drives abort-previous + unmount cleanup). Also threaded the
  signal through `analyzeDonation`→`post`→`fetch` so a superseded analysis cancels its network request, and hardened the
  `.conflicts` derefs against a malformed payload. Gate: config-ui `npm run check` + `build` green. BUG-10 remains.
- **BUG-8 DONE — config-ui DonationsPage composite-key + stale-state defects (the first remediation from the config-ui
  review).** Everything keyed by `${handler}:${language}` now: the 404-fallback no longer stores under the bare handler
  (which caused an **infinite reload loop** + stuck spinner), the validation *catch* stores the error under the key the
  tab indicator reads, the `globalParamNames` memo gained its missing `selectedLanguage` dep (and shed a copy-pasted
  `eslint-disable`), and CrossLanguageValidation renders behind a guarded `selectedHandlerInfo` instead of a non-null
  assertion that crashed if the handler left the list mid-reload. Gate: config-ui `npm run check` + `build` green.
  Remaining review correctness findings: BUG-9 (stale-request overwrite), BUG-10 (unreachable blocking dialog).
- **config-ui review (`config_ui_review.md`) — quality/dup/dead/correctness pass.** 8 finder angles → 1-vote verify.
  Found **5 confirmed + 2 plausible correctness bugs** (404 reload loop, stale-request overwrite, unreachable blocking
  dialog, wrong-key validation error, stale memo), **type-contract drift** in `types/api.ts` (CoreConfig/NLUConfig/
  VADConfig behind the backend — defeats the type-check half of `config-ui-stays-functional` while the editor keeps
  working off the backend schema), **6 duplications** (~500+ lines: apiClient CRUD quintet ×4, Templates/Prompts page
  clones, list/key/card editor primitives), **dead exports** (ESLint only flags unused *locals*), and efficiency +
  hardcoded-list/altitude smells. Baseline `npm run check`/`build` pass — the defects are exactly what those gates
  don't catch. Remediation filed: **BUG-8/9/10** (correctness) + **UI-11** (drift) / **UI-12** (dup) / **UI-13** (dead)
  / **UI-14** (efficiency+altitude), all `[deferred]`. No fixes applied (review → tasks, per `review-then-remediate`).
- **TEST-14 DONE — trace↔WAV unification (record once, test twice).** A golden audio trace already carries its captured
  audio (the bytes `--listen` plays), so a new `irene-replay-trace --extract-wav <file.wav>` decodes it to a standard
  WAV — one golden trace now serves both the offline replay tier AND the live WS suite, no re-recording with a mic.
  Pure trace→WAV transform (standalone CLI mode, no core/replay); writes at the captured rate/channels (Irene's 16 kHz
  mono PCM16 → directly usable as a fixture). Documented in `eval/README`. Gates: suite 1109 passed (+3 tests),
  pyright 0, import-linter 9/9. **Closes the trace-driven system-testing series** (TEST-11→12→13→14); no trace-playback
  TEST- tasks remain open.
- **TEST-13 DONE — failure-trace capture for the live WS suite (S2).** Two pieces: (D-6) when tracing is on, the
  `WorkflowManager` entry points stamp the trace `request_id` onto `result.metadata` — the `/ws/audio` response already
  spreads `result.metadata`, so each case correlates exactly to its saved `<request_id>.json` (no handler change,
  additive, config-ui N/A); (D-13) a new project-agnostic `eval_commons.failures` helper (eval-commons `e740c80`) reads
  the promptfoo results JSON and keeps only the FAILING cases' traces under `traces/failures/`, pruning the rest —
  reusable by wb-mqtt-bridge unchanged. Wired into `eval/Makefile`'s `ws` target behind `TRACE=1` and documented in
  `eval/README` (incl. the offline `--record-out`-on-mismatch tier, D-7, which already existed). A failed case is now
  replayable from the *actual* failing run (`irene-replay-trace --listen --step`). Gates: suite 1106 passed (+ 2
  workflow_manager tests; eval-commons +6), pyright 0, import-linter 9/9. Trace-playback wiring now leaves only
  **TEST-14** (trace↔WAV unification) open.
- **BUG-7 DONE — ru oblique-case numerals normalize to digits.** ovos (ru) reads only nominative numerals, so «одну
  секунду»/«двух минут»/«тридцати пяти» stayed as words and «тридцать одну» even broke to "30 одну". Fix at the
  normalizer altitude (`text_processing.py`): remap the oblique cardinals ovos misses → nominative before ovos (digit
  conversion incl. compounds then fires). Mapped only the forms ovos actually misses; excluded words that collide with
  non-numeric meanings so plain text is never mangled («о семью детях» stays). Verified «одну секунду» → "1 сек",
  «тридцать одну секунду» → "31 сек". Suite 1104 passed, pyright 0, import-linter 9/9. Normalizer-only. Surfaced as the
  BUG-6 bonus finding (had been parked on QUAL-35; resolved here instead).
- **BUG-6 DONE — the "unit story": timer-unit fix + consolidate 3 parsers to one + remove the dead DURATION stub.**
  "set a timer for one second" → "1 min" because the en `unit` param lacked `choice_surfaces` (ru had them) so the weak
  CHOICE extraction defaulted to "minutes", and the correct text fallback was bypassed once `duration` was extracted.
  Right altitude: one shared bilingual parser `irene/utils/units.py` (`TIME_UNITS` + `parse_duration`), made
  authoritative in the timer. Consolidated the 3 unconnected time-unit parsers (timer, `TemporalEntityResolver`,
  `QuantityEntityResolver`) to it. Removed `ParameterType.DURATION` (declared, never coerced, unused) across enum +
  hybrid matcher + contract JSON schema + config-ui (incl. regenerated gen types). Verified "one second" → "1 sec".
  Gates: suite 1103 passed, pyright 0, import-linter 9/9, 12/12 profiles, config-ui green. The general units layer
  (percent/°C) is filed onto **QUAL-35** to be designed *with* smart-home (units come from the bridge device catalog);
  ru «одну/одна» normalize gap noted there. Scoped time-only for now, per user.
- **BUG-4 DONE — per-language defaults + fire-and-forget completion language (all 3 sub-issues, right altitude).**
  Three related defects, one theme (per-language state not threaded to where messages render): (1) donation
  `default_value` flattened to ru → now assembled per-language (`ParameterSpec.default_value_by_language`), threaded via
  `Intent.language` (set in the orchestrator), resolved strictly by request language in `get_param`; (2) **fire-and-
  forget completion language** (the user's catch — a timer is F&F): capture the request language + the rendered
  completion message into the `ActionRecord`, replay at completion; the notification service stopped hardcoding English.
  Verified: en timer → "Timer set for 10 min. Message: Timer completed!" + the deferred completion fires "Timer
  completed!"; ru unchanged. (3) datetime en localization filled (`days_ordinal`/`hours`/`periods`/`special_hours`).
  Suite 1086 passed, pyright 0, import-linter 9/9, 12/12 profiles, config-ui green. The donation en alias/choice
  *enrichment* sweep (non-functional, respect the technical-identifier rule) split out as **BUG-5**.
- **BUG-3 DONE — English replies, at the right altitude: a TTS normalizer was corrupting NLU input.** Deeper analysis
  (per request, "not only timer related") found the en→ru reply was a *symptom of input corruption*: the `prepare`
  normalizer transliterates Latin→Cyrillic ("set a timer"→«сэт е таймё») and ran at the `asr_output` (pre-NLU) stage,
  so English never reached NLU as English → script detection saw Cyrillic → `ru` → every handler replied Russian.
  `prepare` is TTS-only (also spells symbols out), so the fix is to run it at `tts_input` only — schema default +
  `config-master` (the only config pinning it; the rest inherit the default; all 12 profiles validate). Plus: the
  detector's no-signal case now falls back to script (non-Cyrillic ⇒ English) instead of None→default; and the timer's
  own literals are localized (`_format_duration` units, message fallback). English now understood + replied correctly
  across handlers. Suite 1086 passed (2 old-behavior tests updated), pyright 0, import-linter 9/9. Residual noted: the
  timer donation's `message` default_value is Russian (a separate donation-localization concern).
- **BUG-1 DONE — spelled-out numbers now reach parameter extraction (general fix, ru + en).** Research (not just ru)
  found the codebase only ever did DIGITS→WORDS (synthesis) and every extractor matched `\d+` — so English ("ten
  minutes") was broken identically. Added `normalize_numbers_to_digits` (ovos `numbers_to_digits`, ru+en, idempotent,
  safe-degrade) and — after a good catch that a provider-local fix misses spaCy/LLM — applied it **once at the cascade
  entry** (`ContextAwareNLUProcessor.process_with_context`), so every recognizer + the spaCy donation patterns + (via
  normalized `raw_text`) handler text-fallbacks see digits. Also gave the timer's `_parse_timer_from_text` English
  units (it was ru-only). Verified ru/en spelled + compound + digit regression all set the timer; suite 1086 passed,
  pyright 0, import-linter 9/9, 10 new tests. Unblocks a natural-speech timer golden + the WS UX timer case.
- **TEST-12 DONE — config overrides (`--set`) + offline golden-trace replay surface; BUG-2 fixed, BUG-1 filed.**
  Trying to record a golden trace exposed that you couldn't override config settings without hand-editing files.
  Fixed: **`--set DOTTED.KEY=VALUE`** on the base runner (`config/manager.py apply_dotted_overrides`, applied
  pre-validation so Pydantic coerces+validates; strict — an explicit `--set` never silently falls back; 8 tests).
  Built the **golden-trace surface**: `eval/trace.promptfooconfig.yaml` drives `irene-replay-trace` through the
  existing `cli_provider` (assert `exit_code === 0`), `make replay`/`replay-judge`, a committed seed golden
  (`timer_set_10min.json`) that replays green under the WB7 config, `eval/traces/README.md`, the 4th surface in
  `howto-new-test.md`. Also made `diff_output` normalize volatile timestamps (a timer's `started_at`) so deterministic
  handlers stay green goldens. Two bugs surfaced and a new **`BUG` workstream** filed:
  - **BUG-2 (fixed)** — stale `TTS requires Audio` check in `voice_assistant.py` (a drifted duplicate of the canonical
    `CoreConfig` validator, missing the `audio_playback_enabled` condition) rejected the valid WB7 satellite config in
    any runner that didn't force audio on. It was masked by `webapi_runner` hard-setting `components.audio`. Removed the
    duplicate; suite 1074 passed; the WB7 golden replays green with no workaround.
  - **BUG-1 (open)** — spelled-out Russian numerals don't set a timer («десять минут» → no timer; «10 минут» works);
    the golden uses the digit form pending the fix.
  (Reverted the reactive `--set` I'd added to the replay tool — BUG-2's fix made the local-replay workaround unneeded.)
- **TEST-11 DONE (design) — trace-driven system testing → `docs/design/trace_system_testing.md`.** Uses the shipped
  trace record/replay (ARCH-19) two ways: an **offline deterministic regression surface** (committed golden traces
  replayed via `irene-replay-trace --local` through the existing `cli_provider`, asserting `exit_code === 0`; tiered
  `trace-system` vs DeepSeek-judged `trace-ux`) and **failure-trace capture** (always-trace + keep-on-failure for the
  live WS suite via a small `request_id`-in-metadata enabler; `--record-out`-on-mismatch offline) so a failed case is
  replayable (`--listen`/`--step`). No new `eval-commons` code for the core surface. Design done ≠ shipped → filed
  **TEST-12** (offline surface), **TEST-13** (failure-tracing + SUT enabler), **TEST-14** (trace↔WAV, phase 2).
  **Resolved the design's three open questions** (now D-12/13/14; design AGREED): D-12 — `trace-system` is not
  release-gating yet but promotes on a trigger (covers the core paths + 2 consecutive green CI runs); D-13 — the
  keep-on-failure post-step is a generic `eval-commons` helper (reusable by the bridge), not a per-project step; D-14 —
  seed a small deterministic golden set now and grow it from real failures (failure-tracing feeds the golden set).
- **TEST-10 DONE — WS audio fixtures are now versioned.** A blanket `*.wav` ignore had accidentally swept the eval
  fixtures in, making the WS suite un-runnable in CI (no mic) and non-reproducible (re-record → different WER). Carved
  `!eval/fixtures/*.wav` out of the ignore; other `*.wav` stay ignored. Fixtures are test inputs, not stray audio.
  `fixtures/README.md` updated. The deeper "golden traces as reviewable regression inputs" direction is in the
  trace-system-testing design.
- **DOC-9 DONE — user-facing eval guide.** Added `docs/guides/howto-new-test.md` (+ decision diagram
  `howto-test.dot/png`) in the established `howto-*` voice: pick a surface (CLI contract / WS system / WS UX-judged),
  author a case in each, record the fixture (`make record`), keep cases endpoint-agnostic (TARGET/CONFIG). Wired into
  the howto index (`CONTRIBUTING.md` "Add a test" + the top-level `README` pointer, beside add-an-intent/model/language)
  and cross-linked from `eval/README.md` as the walkthrough to its reference. Closes the "how do I add a test?" gap
  surfaced once the recorder made the WS suite actually authorable.
- **TEST-9 DONE — voice-fixture recorder wired into `eval/` (W6).** The recorder itself (design + W1–W5) was built and
  pushed in the sibling **eval-commons** repo (`eval-fixture-record`: mic capture → 16 kHz/mono/PCM16, worklist derived
  from the promptfoo YAML, interactive keep/redo); it lives there because eval-commons is the shared lower layer and
  must not import a consumer's audio stack (cycle). This repo's W6 wiring: `make record`/`record-list`/`record-devices`/
  `setup-record`; `profiles/recording.env.example` (real file git-ignored); `reference` added to the `light_unreachable`
  judge case so the recorder has a script (§5 decision); `fixtures/README.md` + `eval/README.md` repointed at
  `make record`. Verified end-to-end (`record-list` derives both fixtures, console script resolves, `make cli` 5/5).
  Unblocks the WS suite's fixture gap — recording the WAVs is now a clean manual step. eval-commons has no ledger; its
  side is tracked in its design doc §13 + commit `965153c`.
- **API execution-result contract review → QUAL-54 (done) + QUAL-55 (filed).** Surfaced while wiring the `eval/` WS
  suite: the `ws_audio_provider` reads `metadata.intent_name`, which `/ws/audio` never emits. Reviewed the execution
  surfaces and found a **family** of inconsistencies (no shared result serializer) — captured in
  `docs/review/api_result_contract_review.md` (F1 reply field `response` vs `text`; F2 3-way intent split; F3 one
  response model, two metadata payloads; F4 `confidence` placement; F5 internal `intent_name` read always `None`).
  **QUAL-54 (targeted, done):** `/ws/audio` now surfaces `intent_name` (remapped from `original_intent`) at both send
  sites + `workflow_manager` pipeline events read `original_intent` (fixing the live `None`). `test_pipeline_events`'s
  fake used the wrong key (`intent_name`), masking the bug — corrected to `original_intent`, now a faithful regression.
  Full suite 1066 passed, pyright 0, import-linter 9/9. **QUAL-55 (open):** one canonical serializer across all five
  surfaces (retires F1/F3/F4 + rest of F2; `config-ui` co-change). Unblocks the eval WS intent case.
- **UI-10 DONE — config-ui major dependency upgrades; all 8 Dependabot alerts cleared.** The 6 the housekeeping pass
  couldn't touch needed breaking majors outside the declared ranges, so they were a deliberate version decision (filed
  as UI-10, done same session): `vite ^5`→`^8.1.0` (+ `@vitejs/plugin-react`→`^6`; vite 8 = rolldown bundler) cleared
  the 3 vite advisories + esbuild; `react-syntax-highlighter ^15`→`^16` cleared prismjs (the only runtime one — `Prism`
  API unchanged); `@typescript-eslint ^6`→`^8` (eslint kept at 8.57 — stayed on eslintrc, no flat-config migration)
  cleared the minimatch ReDoS. ts-eslint 8's stricter type-checked config surfaced 6 lint errors (5 auto-fixed, 1
  optional-catch). `npm run check` + `build` + vitest 40/40 green; `npm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities. Upgraded
  incrementally (gate after each major) so breakage stayed isolated.
- **config-ui dependency housekeeping — lockfile-only, no ledger ID** (per the `every-task-in-the-ledger`
  carve-out). `npm audit fix` lifted `@babel/core`→7.29.7 and `js-yaml`→4.2.0 in `config-ui/package-lock.json`;
  `package.json` intent unchanged, `npm run check && npm run build` green. Cleared 2 of 8 Dependabot alerts. The
  other 6 need **breaking major upgrades outside the declared ranges** — `vite ^5`→6/8 (3 vite alerts + esbuild),
  `react-syntax-highlighter ^15`→16 (prismjs), `@typescript-eslint ^6`→8 (minimatch) — i.e. deliberate version
  decisions, not housekeeping; to be carried as a ledger task, not auto-applied.
- **Work-process redesign: ledger split + journal rotation (size control).** The ledger and journal had grown to
  ~71k / ~88k tokens (~159k combined; 106 of 127 ledger tasks done, 264 journal entries), past the point where the
  harness keeps them resident — every task that obeys `read-at-start-record-at-completion`/`task-start-reconciliation` was paying to load mostly-closed history.
  Completed work is reference-by-ID, not working-set, so it can be archived without losing the trail. Changes:
  - **`one-active-journal` amended** — "one journal" → "one *active* journal + frozen dated archives." The old wording ("no
    dated journals anywhere else") forbade the fix, though its real target is *drift* (two competing **live** logs).
    Reworded to permit append-only, frozen, greppable archives under `docs/archive/journal/` outside the default-read
    path, with a discoverability pointer at the top of the active journal.
  - **`single-task-ledger` extended** — the ledger now spans two files: active `RELEASE_PLAN.md` (open + paused/partial) +
    frozen `RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md` (completed `[x]`, by workstream). One ledger, every ID in exactly one file; on
    completion a task **moves** active → done. `scripts/check_scope.py` now reads both for declarations (else
    references to completed tasks read as orphans) — verified 0 orphans / 0 dead links after the split.
  - **Split executed:** 106 completed tasks moved to `RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md`; active ledger 71k → ~10k tokens.
  - **First journal rotation:** sections dated 2026-05-31 … 2026-06-14 frozen into
    `docs/archive/journal/pre-2026-06-15.md`; active journal keeps 2026-06-15 onward, 88k → ~23k tokens.
  - **Invariants relocated to `CLAUDE.md` + numbering retired.** All 10 invariants moved to `CLAUDE.md` →
    "Development process — invariants" (single source of truth, always in context = always enforced); the ledger's
    Invariants section is now just a pointer. To kill drift permanently, invariants are referenced by **stable name**
    (slug: `work-on-main`, `single-task-ledger`, `task-start-reconciliation`, …), **not number** — names survive
    add/remove/reorder so references never break. The ~134 `#N` refs in the frozen archives + review docs are left
    intact and resolve via a one-time number→name **legend** in `CLAUDE.md`; the 27 live refs in the active
    ledger/journal were converted to slugs. Net default-read working set: ~159k → ~33k tokens.
  - **Three development-process invariants added** (numbering retired, so no renumbering): `every-task-in-the-ledger`
    (file every task before working it, regardless of source — chat / GitHub issue / code-review finding),
    `design-then-implement` (a feature/redesign task delivers a **design doc**; implementation is filed as follow-up
    tasks on completion), `review-then-remediate` (a review — chat-requested or via `/code-review` — is a task that
    delivers a **review doc**; findings are filed as fresh tasks). Formalizes the intake + design/review pipelines the
    repo already followed informally.
  - **Journal rotation trigger defined** in `one-active-journal` (was permissive-but-undated): at each gate, if the
    active journal exceeds ~1500 lines / ~40k tokens, freeze the oldest whole dated sections into the newest archive
    until back under ~1000 lines / ~25k tokens. Closes the only "when" gap — task-moves were already per-completion.
  - **`user-facing-docs-are-done` scope widened** to add `docs/QUICKSTART.md` (always) + non-root `README*` (e.g.
    `eval/README.md`) — the latter **only when the task touches that README's directory/subsystem** (locality gate, so
    it isn't a "re-audit every README" burden). Closes the scope gaps surfaced when reviewing the invariant.
  - **`every-task-in-the-ledger` carve-out for routine dependency housekeeping** (surfaced while porting the
    invariants to the sister project `wb-mqtt-bridge`): a lockfile-only bump that doesn't change `pyproject.toml` /
    `config-ui/package.json` intent (`npm audit fix`, `uv lock` refresh, Dependabot lock refresh) needs no ledger ID —
    just a journal line on completion; deliberate version decisions still need a task. Keeps the two repos' invariant
    sets in sync (same rule, two dialects).
