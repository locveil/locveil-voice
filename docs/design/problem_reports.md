# Problem reporting end-to-end («сообщи о проблеме»)

**Status: AGREED 2026-07-06 (interactive design session, ARCH-30). D-1..D-10 all user-approved
(P-1..P-4 accepted as proposed and renumbered D-7..D-10).**

A user tells Irene something is wrong; Irene collects a support bundle and files a ticket; a
GitHub-hosted Claude triages it — fixing, delegating, or escalating; the owner reviews fixes and
escalations one-by-one with the local Claude. The reporter never needs a GitHub account, an email,
or any identity at all (a user registry is a later release).

## 1. Agreed decisions

- **D-1 — Backend topology: a private triage home.** One private repo, **`wb-user-reports`**
  _(renamed/moved to **`locveil/locveil-reports`** 2026-07-11 with the Locveil productization;
  the old name redirects — mentions of `wb-user-reports` below refer to the same repo)_,
  holds BOTH the tickets (GitHub issues) and the raw bundles. The Claude triage workflow lives in
  this repo — not in the public code repos. Rationale: both code repos are public, and bundles
  narrate the household (rooms, devices, daily rhythms, free-form speech); redacting free-form
  logs for public posting is a losing game. Fix PRs still land on the public code repos.
- **D-2 — One Claude, two lenses — handover by label, not transfer.** "Voice Claude" and "bridge
  Claude" are process *roles*, not separate installations. A ticket carries `lens:voice` or
  `lens:bridge`; the triage workflow checks out the corresponding public codebase and applies that
  lens's process file. Voice→bridge delegation = flip the label + post a structured handover
  comment (§7.3) on the SAME ticket — full history preserved, no cross-repo copy.
- **D-3 — Shared intake.** The bridge UI's future "Report a problem" button files into the same
  repo with the same envelope (§5), `lens:bridge` set at filing. Its payload specifics are the
  bridge's own design session (VWB filing at ARCH-30 completion).
- **D-4 — Bundle retention: 30 days.** A scheduled workflow in `wb-user-reports` prunes bundle
  files older than 30 days; issues and their distilled inline summaries persist. Privacy decays by
  default; triage history does not.
- **D-5 — Verbatim-capture window: configurable, default 90 s.** After Irene asks for the
  description, the next utterance within the window is consumed RAW (§3). On expiry the report
  dies unfiled and commands behave normally. No re-prompt loops.
- **D-6 — No raw audio in v1.** The failing utterance's audio would be diagnostic gold for ASR
  bugs, but it is a voice recording leaving the house — explicitly a later, opt-in feature.

## 2. The dialog (voice side)

New handler + intent **`report.problem`** (own small handler — own donation, templates, wiring;
phrases: «сообщи о проблеме», «у меня проблема», «что-то не работает», «пожаловаться» — routing
checked against the QUAL-64 suite so it collides with nothing).

Turn 1 — `report.problem` fires → Irene answers from a template: «Опишите проблему своими
словами» — and arms a **verbatim-capture** state: the existing pending-clarification slot
(QUAL-30/31) extended with `mode: "verbatim"` and `expires_at`.

Turn 2 — the workflow checks the pending state BEFORE the QUAL-44 arbitration: in verbatim mode
the utterance is **not** re-run through NLU as a potential command — a description like «свет в
спальне не включается» must not be hijacked into `smart_home.power_on` and executed. The raw text
becomes the report's `description`; the bundle is assembled and handed to the delivery path (§6);
Irene confirms: «Отчёт отправлен, спасибо» (or the offline variant, §6).

Escapes and expiry:
- **Cancel words** («отмена», «не важно», «забудь»; en: "cancel", "never mind") end the capture
  with a polite acknowledgement, nothing filed.
- **TTL expiry** (D-5): state cleared silently; the next utterance is an ordinary command. No
  nagging — if the user still cares, they say «сообщи о проблеме» again.
- The dialog is fully template-driven (ru + en; QUAL-71 discipline — no hardcoded strings).

## 3. What the bundle contains

Assembled by a new `ReportBundleCollector` (core service):

| Item | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| user free text | verbatim capture | also inlined into the issue body |
| conversation window | `UnifiedConversationContext.conversation_history` | last 10 turns — NOT just the previous utterance: users retry before complaining, F&F failures surface late, output-side failures leave a clean last turn |
| recent + failed action records | client registry | the F&F/durable view of "what was running" |
| request traces | **new: rolling in-memory ring buffer, last 5 requests** | trace *persistence* is off by default in deployments; the ring is always on, dumped only into bundles (memory cost ≈ a few hundred KB) |
| NLU cascade verdicts | ring-buffer traces | which provider won, at what confidence — half of any misroute diagnosis |
| today's log | `logs/irene.log` + same-day rotated files | gzipped (~10:1); text logs are single-digit MB |
| config | the loaded config file, **redaction pass** (§4) | |
| metadata | version, git commit, config profile, platform/arch, **pinned catalog version**, ASR/TTS/NLU providers, session language, room/client id, timestamp, `smart_home_involved` + `bridge_evidence` status (ARCH-34) | catalog version instantly tells the bridge lens whether the contract is stale |
| bridge evidence (ARCH-34) | `GET /reports/evidence` on the bridge (contract v1.4, B-11), fetched at filing time whenever `[outputs.bridge]` is wired | the bridge's own redacted `EvidenceEnvelope` (dispatch ring, MQTT window, live states, state diffs — the contract the bridge owns, pinned in locveil-commons) under `bridge/evidence.json`; any fetch failure is filed verbatim as `bridge/unavailable.json` — **unreachable IS evidence**, never fatal; 429 (the endpoint's gzip rate guard) handled the same way. Not gated on a smart-home heuristic — over-attaching into the same private repo is free |

**§4 Redaction:** applied to config AND log excerpts before packaging: values of any key matching
`*_API_KEY|token|password|secret|credential` (BUG-20 family), `Authorization:` headers, and
`.env`-style assignments quoted in logs. LAN hostnames/room names stay — the repo is private
(D-1); the *leak fence* (§7.4) guards the public boundary instead.

## 5. The envelope (shared voice/bridge intake format)

One filing = one issue + one bundle commit in `wb-user-reports`:

- **Bundle**: `reports/<UTC-timestamp>-<source>-<room>/bundle.tar.gz` (contents API, base64; a
  release asset if ever >25 MB).
- **Issue title**: `[voice] <first 60 chars of free text>` (or `[bridge-ui]`).
- **Issue body** (the distilled summary — triage usually needn't open the tarball): free text
  verbatim (language preserved), last-3-turns synopsis, versions/profile/arch/catalog, bundle
  link, `report-id`.
- **Labels at filing**: `problem-report`, `lens:voice` (or `lens:bridge`), `new`.

## 6. Delivery from the device

- New port **`ReportSinkPort`** + adapter **`GitHubReportSink`** (issues + contents API). Config
  `[reports]`: `enabled`, `repo`, `token_env` (fine-grained PAT: issues:write + contents:write on
  `wb-user-reports` ONLY), `capture_ttl_seconds = 90`, rate limits (below).
- **Offline/failure path = the ARCH-27 durable substrate, used as designed**: the bundle spools to
  `<assets_root>/state/reports/` and submission is launched `durable=True` with re-arm — retries
  survive restarts. Irene says so honestly: «Сейчас нет связи — отправлю отчёт, как только
  появится».
- **D-7 — client-side rate limit (accepted)**: max 3 reports/hour, 10/day per device; the 4th gets
  «Я уже отправила несколько отчётов — дайте мне немного времени». Guards against ASR misfires
  and frustration-mashing.
- **D-8 — no client-side dedup (accepted).** Volume is household-scale; dedup is the triage
  Claude's job (its process file: search open tickets first; a duplicate becomes a comment on the
  existing ticket, not a new fix).

## 7. Triage choreography (`wb-user-reports`)

- **7.1 Trigger**: Actions workflow on `issues: opened, labeled` + `issue_comment: created`
  (owner replies re-trigger analysis), running the Claude code action under the owner's
  subscription OAuth (repo secret). The Claude GitHub App is installed on `wb-user-reports`,
  `locveil-voice`, `locveil-bridge`.
- **D-11 — Model policy: one model, the strongest generally available (`claude-fable-5`), for the
  whole run — triage AND code work.** Rationale: report volume is household-scale (a handful per
  week at worst), so there is nothing to optimize by tiering models — while the code path performs
  UNATTENDED root-cause analysis and authors PRs, exactly the work where capability dominates
  cost. A split (cheap triage pass → strong fix pass) is a later optimization if volume ever
  grows; the retention-pruning job is a plain script, no model at all. The model ID is pinned in
  one place (workflow env var), so upgrades are deliberate acts, not silent drift. Subscription
  note: action runs share the owner's plan usage with local sessions — irrelevant at expected
  volume, worth remembering if a report storm ever coincides with a heavy local day.
- **7.2 The four outcomes** (per-lens process files, `.github/claude/lens-voice.md` /
  `lens-bridge.md`):
  1. **Real, fixable** → check out the code repo, reproduce where possible (unit suite, `make
     cli`, device suite against the mock bridge), fix, open a PR on the PUBLIC code repo
     (referencing the private ticket), label the ticket `fix-pr-open`.
  2. **Voice clean, bridge suspected** → handover (§7.3), label → `lens:bridge`, next run applies
     the bridge lens. And symmetrically back — with a **ping-pong guard**: a ticket that has
     already been handed over once in each direction escalates to the owner instead of bouncing.
  3. **Unclear, reporter unknown** (v1: always — no user registry) → label `needs-owner`, and
     **draft the reply to the reporter in the reporter's language** (from the free text) as a
     comment, so the owner approves rather than composes. (When identity channels exist later,
     outcome 3a "ask the reporter directly" activates.)
  4. **Duplicate / not a bug / user error** → comment the reasoning, label `needs-owner` for a
     one-glance close (v1 keeps a human on every closure).
- **7.3 Handover comment schema** (the voice→bridge contract, versioned in the doc): symptom (one
  sentence), evidence extracted (log lines, trace slice, capture of the canonical command sent),
  catalog version pinned vs live, what the sending lens ruled OUT, back-links. The receiving lens
  reads THIS, not the raw bundle, first.
- **7.4 Leak fence** (both lens files): anything posted to the PUBLIC repos (PRs, commits, code
  comments) describes defects technically — never quotes logs, room/device names, free text, or
  config values. The private ticket is the only place household data appears.
- **7.5 Loop safety**: the workflow ignores issues/comments authored by the Claude app itself;
  label-gated (`problem-report` only); concurrency-capped to one run per ticket.

## 8. The owner's review loop (local Claude, both code repos)

- New user-invocable skill **`/inbox`** in `locveil-voice` and `locveil-bridge`: lists (a) open
  fix PRs on that repo, (b) `needs-owner` tickets in `wb-user-reports` for that repo's lens — then
  walks them ONE BY ONE interactively (approve/revise the drafted reply, review the PR diff,
  merge/close decisions stay with the owner).
- One line in each repo's CLAUDE.md: at session start, mention (not auto-run) when `/inbox` has
  items — the owner decides when to enter review mode.

## 9. Config & secrets summary

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| device (`[reports]` in config + env) | fine-grained PAT → `wb-user-reports` only |
| `wb-user-reports` secrets | Claude OAuth token (owner's subscription) |
| Claude GitHub App installs | reports + voice + bridge repos |
| public repos | nothing new |

## 10. Implementation plan (tasks to file at design completion)

1. Verbatim-capture mode on the pending-clarification state + workflow pre-check (before QUAL-44).
2. `report` handler + donation + templates (ru/en) + routing regression cases.
3. Trace ring buffer (last 5 requests, always on).
4. `ReportBundleCollector` + redaction pass + envelope builder.
5. `ReportSinkPort` + `GitHubReportSink` + `[reports]` config + durable spool/retry + rate limit.
6. `wb-user-reports` repo bootstrap: labels, triage workflow, two lens process files, retention
   pruning workflow, Claude app installs + secrets (owner actions listed step-by-step).
7. `/inbox` skill (voice repo) + CLAUDE.md line.
8. Cross-repo filings (uncommitted, per `cross-repo-source-of-truth`): bridge `/inbox` skill +
   CLAUDE.md line; bridge UI "Report a problem" button (same envelope, `lens:bridge`).
9. Eval: the dialog flow (arm → verbatim → cancel/TTL) as unit tests; a mock-sink e2e for the
   bundle path.

## 11. Later (explicitly out of v1)

User registry + direct-reply channels (mail/Telegram/GitHub identity); raw-audio opt-in; curated
public issues for confirmed OSS-relevant bugs; auto-close policies; bridge-side bundle specifics.

**D-9 (accepted)**: the `report.problem` phrases as authored in §2 (native-speaker pass done at
the AGREED sign-off).
**D-10 (accepted)**: ring buffer depth 5 and the D-7 rate-limit numbers are tunable defaults in
`[reports]`.
