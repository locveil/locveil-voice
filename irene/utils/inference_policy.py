"""Shared inference policy for the sherpa-onnx provider family (ARCH-24 T5).

The sherpa-onnx ASR, VAD and Piper-TTS providers all run onnxruntime sessions and all need the same
**thread/CPU budget** decision. This was duplicated (a `SherpaInferencePolicy` in the ASR provider, a
`_num_threads()` in the Piper provider, and the silero VAD ignoring it entirely). Factor it here so
every sherpa provider reads one policy and `num_threads` is set consistently on the A7/A53.

This is **not** a shared session — each provider still builds its own sherpa object (the
`from_transducer` / `from_whisper` / `VoiceActivityDetector` / `OfflineTts` APIs don't unify). Only
the thread/CPU budget is shared.
