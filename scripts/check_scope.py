check_scope.py — release-scope drift guard (invariant `single-task-ledger`).

The task ledger (docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md) is the single source of scope + status.
Review/design docs are frozen evidence that link UP to ledger task IDs. This script
proves nothing has drifted between them. Run it at each gate; wire into CI later.

Reports (and exits non-zero on) :
  1. ORPHAN finding      — a task ID referenced in a review/design doc but NOT declared
                           in the ledger (scope hiding in a review doc — `single-task-ledger`).
  2. DEAD evidence link  — a file named in the ledger's "Review documents" index that
                           does not exist on disk.
  3. UNINDEXED review    — a docs/review/*.md that the ledger index never references
                           (stray evidence / possible un-rolled-up scope).

Informational (never fails the build):
  - Ledger status summary (open / done / paused per workstream).
