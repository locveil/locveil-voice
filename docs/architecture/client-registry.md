# Client registry

The client registry is Irene's memory of **who is connected and what they are doing**. It holds two stores
with very different lifetimes, bound together by one idea — *physical identity*.

![The client registry](../images/client-registry.png)

- **Registrations** — *persisted.* Who is out there: each `ClientRegistration` is a connected client (an
  ESP32 node, a web client) with its `client_id` and its `room_name` — its **identity and location**, not a
  device catalogue (smart-home devices come from the bridge; see below). Survives restarts.
- **The action store** — *runtime only.* What is running right now: one `ActionRecord` per live
  fire-and-forget action. It holds a live `asyncio.Task` reference, so it must never be persisted — it is
  deliberately kept separate from the registrations.

## Registrations

A client registers once, declaring **who and where it is**:

```python
await registry.register_esp32_node(
    client_id="kitchen_node", room_name="Кухня",
    devices=[],          # a satellite reports no smart-home devices — the bridge owns those
    language="ru",
)
```

`register_web_client` does the same for a browser. A voice satellite declares a little more in its handshake:
the **room(s) it covers** (a primary room plus any others it manages), its **output audio capability** (so a
spoken reply is conformed down to what it can actually play), and its **firmware/model versions** (so the
controller knows when to push an update). What it does **not** carry is the smart-home devices in the room —
a satellite is a pure voice terminal that knows nothing about lights or switches.

**Device knowledge lives with the bridge.** Irene pulls a device/room catalogue from `locveil-bridge` — the
single device authority (see [MQTT](mqtt.md)) — and *that* is what NLU resolves "the kitchen light" against.
(A registration can technically still carry a `ClientDevice` list; it's a holdover from the early handshake,
not the catalogue.) Registrations themselves are queryable — `get_client`, `get_clients_by_room`,
`get_all_rooms` — and can be pruned of stale entries on request (`cleanup_expired_clients`, an
administrative action: a quiet-but-still-connected satellite is never expired automatically).

## Physical identity

`resolve_physical_id(client_id, room_name, session_id)` collapses those into one **stable scope** — the room
or device a request belongs to, independent of the conversation. It is the key everything addresses by, and
the reason it isn't the session id is simple: **sessions expire, rooms don't.**

## The action store

When a handler launches a fire-and-forget action (a timer, playback), it records an `ActionRecord` keyed by
its `action_name` and scoped by `physical_id`. The record carries:

- the live `task` — the authoritative "is it still running?" signal;
- `source` — the originating channel (cli / web / ws), so a **deferred result is delivered back to where the
  request came from**;
- `domain`, `started_at`, `expected_end`, `status` — for routing, timeouts and listing.

This store is what makes the deferred half of fire-and-forget work, and what lets a later "стоп" find the
running action by the same physical scope (see [data flow](dataflow.md)). Because it is keyed on the room or
device rather than the conversation, a result still finds home after the session is gone — the same identity
the [smart-home layer](mqtt.md) and the [ESP32 satellites](esp32.md) address by.

**Durable actions.** An action launched as *durable* — today that's timers — also writes an **intent
record** to a small state file under the assets tree: no task reference, just what is needed to relaunch. On
startup Irene reconciles it: a timer whose moment is still ahead is re-armed with its remaining time; one
missed by less than an hour rings late with an apology; older ones are announced as expired. If the room's
speaker happens to be offline right when a durable action fires, the announcement is kept and spoken when the
device reconnects. The live store above stays runtime-only — it is the persisted *intent* that crosses a
restart, never the task.
