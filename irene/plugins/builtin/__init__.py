"""
Builtin Plugin Package - Plugin discovery via entry-points

Builtin plugins are now discovered dynamically via entry-points defined in pyproject.toml.
This module provides the base classes and utilities for builtin plugins.

Entry-points catalog in pyproject.toml:
[project.entry-points."irene.plugins.builtin"]
random_plugin = "irene.plugins.builtin.random_plugin:RandomPlugin"
async_service_demo = "irene.plugins.builtin.async_service_demo:AsyncServiceDemoPlugin"

The hardcoded plugin module lists have been eliminated in favor of dynamic discovery.
"""

# NOTE: The get_builtin_plugins() function has been replaced by dynamic discovery
# via entry-points. Plugins are now discovered using:
# dynamic_loader.discover_providers("irene.plugins.builtin", enabled_plugins)

# For backward compatibility, preserve base imports
from ..base import PluginInterface
