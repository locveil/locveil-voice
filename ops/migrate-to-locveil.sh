# ONE-TIME controller migration: wb-mqtt-voice -> locveil-voice (BUILD-29).
# Everything renames: the systemd unit, the runtime tree on /mnt/data, the images,
# the container. Models, durable state, logs and .env move WITH the runtime tree.
#
# Run on the controller, as root, AFTER renaming the SD-card clone:
#
#   systemctl stop wb-mqtt-voice 2>/dev/null || true
#   cd /mnt/sdcard && mv wb-mqtt-voice locveil-voice
#   cd locveil-voice && git pull && sh ops/migrate-to-locveil.sh
#
# Prerequisite: the locveil-voice images exist on GHCR and are PUBLIC
# (ghcr.io/locveil/locveil-voice-armv7 — first publish creates the package
# private; flip it in the org package settings, same as the old ones).

systemctl disable --now wb-mqtt-voice 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/wb-mqtt-voice.service
systemctl daemon-reload

# 2. Make sure the old stack is down, then rename the runtime tree.
#    (The compose project follows the directory name, so the old project must be
#    torn down from the OLD path before it disappears.)

fi

# 3. Normal update flow under the new identity: delivers config + compose into the
#    new tree, pulls ghcr.io/locveil/locveil-voice-*, starts the stack.
./update.sh

# 4. Wire the new unit to boot (COPY, don't symlink — SD card is a lazy automount).
cp locveil-voice.service /etc/systemd/system/

# 5. Drop the old-name images; keep the flash lean.
