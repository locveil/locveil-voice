# Audio fixtures

Record/synthesize these as **16 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM WAV** (the `/ws/audio` wire format —
the provider validates this and won't resample, so tests measure the ASR, not a converter).

| File | Spoken (Russian) | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `timer_10min.wav` | «поставь таймер на десять минут» | cases 1, 2, 3 |
| `light_unreachable.wav` | a command targeting a device that will be unreachable | case 4 |

Fixtures are git-ignored by default (binary). To version them, drop a `.gitignore`
exception or use git-lfs. The spoken text lives in each case's `reference:` var in
`../ws.promptfooconfig.yaml` — the recorder reads it to you, so it stays in sync.

## Record them: `make record`

One-time setup (adds the mic deps), then record the missing fixtures interactively:

```bash
make setup-record                 # adds sounddevice + soxr to the venv (once)
cp profiles/recording.env.example profiles/recording.env   # then set REC_INPUT_DEVICE
make record-devices               # ... find your device name/index for that file
make record-list                  # what's needed/missing (no mic)
make record                       # record every missing fixture (prompt → record → playback → keep/redo)
make record FIXTURE=timer_10min   # just one
```

The recorder (eval-commons' `eval-fixture-record`) shows the line to read, records from
the configured mic, lets you re-take, and writes a conformant **16 kHz / mono / PCM16** WAV —
validated on save against the same check the `/ws/audio` provider applies.

### Alternative: synthesize from TTS, then conform the format

```bash
ffmpeg -i raw.wav -ar 16000 -ac 1 -sample_fmt s16 timer_10min.wav
```
