# Audio pipeline — negotiation + transformation seam (ARCH-17)

The **input twin of ARCH-15**. ARCH-14/15 (`io_architecture.md`) made *output* a configurable, negotiated,
observable adapter set; the audio *input* chain (mic → VAD → wake → ASR) never got the same treatment, and
audio *encoding* (sample rate / format / channels) is handled ad-hoc below the coarse `VOICE/AUDIO/TEXT`
format axis. This design unifies three threads into one seam and **supersedes `onnx_inference_layer.md` §11.2's
"small VAD seam" decision** (the seam grew a third engine, an asset dependency, and platform markers — it is
now component-shaped). Design session 2026-06-10 (decisions §14).

## 1. The three threads (one root)

| Thread | Today | Smell |
|---|---|---|
| **VAD selection** | a 4-way `if/else` in `UniversalAudioProcessor.__init__` keyed on `vad_implementation`; engines are util classes | scattered knowledge → a shipped bug: a validator that rejects `microvad` (`models.py:457`). (The suspected `calibrate_threshold` issue turned out benign — the ABC defaults it; see §10.) |
| **Frame preservation** | a hardcoded `pre_buffer_size = 4` (~100 ms) prepended on voice onset | not coupled to the engine's detection latency → silero/microvad (or a high `voice_frames_required`) can clip the wake-word onset, because the segment feeds the wake word |
| **Format/rate negotiation** | `voice_trigger` capability-negotiates; ASR config-resamples; each provider re-implements int16→float; `AudioProcessor.resample_audio_data` is shared by input *and* output but the TTS side copy-pastes it 3× | no single seam, format barely negotiated, transforms logged-not-traced — i.e. not transparent |

Root cause: **the audio chain has no declared, negotiated, observable contract layer** — the thing ARCH-15
just gave the output side.

## 2. The model — canonical, transform-once, derived

One **canonical internal audio format** flows through the pipeline; the mic is transformed to it **once** at
the input boundary, and every downstream stage (VAD, wake, ASR) consumes canonical.

- **Derived, not configured.** The `AudioNegotiator` computes the canonical from the parties' *declared*
  `AudioContract`s — the common format all consumers require that the capture can be brought **down** to
  (downsample / downmix / reformat; never upsample to invent data). Per dimension:
  - *rate* — the highest rate all consumers need, ≤ the capture rate;
  - *channels* — mono (consumers need mono; stereo capture is downmixed);
  - *sample-format* — int16↔float32 are losslessly inter-convertible, so canonical is a free pick (int16 = the compact capture default; convert where a consumer wants float32).
- **Config can pin.** Optional `[audio] canonical_rate/format/channels` for operators who want determinism;
  an infeasible pin is the same fatal error.
- **Fatal if impossible.** If no canonical satisfies everyone (e.g. a consumer needs 48 kHz but capture is
  16 kHz), it's a **fatal config error at startup** — loud and early. This generalizes today's
  `allow_resampling=false → error` from one hand-set knob to automatic, capability-driven validation.

The **satellite path falls out for free**: the WS adapter declares it delivers 16 kHz/int16/mono → canonical
= no-op transform.

## 3. The harmonized component set (names locked)

| Component | Role | Used by | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`AudioTranscoder`** (rename of `utils/audio_helpers.AudioProcessor`) | the one transform primitive: rate + channels + sample-format, with `ConversionMethod` quality tiers | **input** negotiator **and** **output** (TTS→playback) | `utils` |
| **`AudioContract`** (new value object) | what a party can deliver / needs | every input adapter + audio consumer | `utils` |
| **`AudioNegotiator`** (new) | derive canonical, validate at startup (fatal), drive the transcoder, emit trace events | input boundary + output | startup: config path · runtime: boundary |
| **`VoiceSegmenter`** (rename of `UniversalAudioProcessor`, minus the if-else) | consume the active VAD provider; own pre-roll; emit `VoiceSegment`s | the audio workflow | `workflows` |
| **`VADProvider` + `irene.providers.vad.*`** | per-frame `is_voice` engines (energy / silero / microvad) | the segmenter | `providers` (adapter-port) |

This collapses the two colliding `AudioProcessor`s and the 3 duplicated TTS resample blocks into one named,
direction-shared transcoder.

## 4. `AudioContract` (replaces the scattered capability methods)

Supersedes the per-provider `get_supported_sample_rates` / `get_default_sample_rate` / `supports_resampling`
/ `get_default_channels` (inconsistently consulted today):

```
AudioContract {
    supported_rates:    list[int]          # e.g. [16000]
    preferred_rate:     int
    supported_formats:  list[str]          # "pcm16" | "float32"
    preferred_format:   str
    channels:           int                # 1
    detection_latency_ms: int | None       # VAD only — drives pre-roll (§6)
}
```

Each **input adapter** (microphone / web / ws) declares what it *delivers*; each **consumer** (VAD / wake /
ASR provider) declares what it *needs*. The negotiator intersects them.

## 5. VAD as a lightweight provider family

The 8th provider family, but **without the component web/manager apparatus** (it's a per-frame hot-path
primitive, not a request/response service):

- `VADProvider` (`irene/providers/vad/base.py`, the adapter-port — same shape `voice_trigger` uses; **no
  separate `core/interfaces` port** needed since `VoiceSegmenter` imports it inward) — `process_frame(AudioData)
  -> VADResult`, `reset()`, `detection_latency_ms` (property), `calibrate(frames) -> bool` **with a default
  no-op** (energy opts in). The low-level `utils.vad.VADEngine` ABC stays as the engine contract the providers
  wrap.
- `irene.providers.vad`: `energy` (today's `SimpleVAD`/`AdvancedVAD`), `silero`, `microvad`. As adapters they
  may import `core/assets` directly — **the silero model-path injection workaround disappears**.
- Selection = the standard entry-points discovery + `default_provider` single-active pattern (the
  `voice_trigger` template), replacing the if-else. Config nests `[vad.providers.*]` like every component.

## 6. Pre-roll as a contract (Q1)

`VoiceSegmenter` sizes the pre-buffer from the **active VAD provider's `detection_latency_ms(frame_ms)`**:
`preroll_frames = ceil(detection_latency_ms / frame_ms) + margin`, where `frame_ms` is the **real canonical
frame duration** observed on the first frame (no magic ms/frame constant). The latency declaration is
harmonized across providers: **energy** is frame-count-based (`round(voice_frames_required · frame_ms)`, so
it scales with the real frame and its pre-roll collapses to `voice_frames_required + margin`); **silero** =
`voice_duration_ms` and **microvad** = a `detection_latency_ms` TOML field — both duration-based (ms,
frame-independent). This replaces the magic `4` and guarantees the wake-word onset survives across engines and
tunings (the segment feeds the wake word, so this is a detection-correctness fix, not just nicety).

## 7. Transparency — first-class trace events

Every transform (`resample 44.1k→16k`, `downmix 2→1`, `int16→float32`) is recorded as a **trace event** via
the existing `trace_context`/observe vocabulary (ARCH-15), so a `/trace` shows the full chain end-to-end.
Plus a **one-time startup summary**: the negotiated canonical + every party's contract (and the fatal-error
detail when negotiation fails).

## 8. Symmetric output (PR-4c design — locked 2026-06-10)

The negotiator runs **both directions** through the *same* `core.AudioNegotiator` + `AudioTranscoder`, traced.
Output is the **mirror of input, inverted** — but driven by the **sink's** capability, not the producer's:

| | Input (done) | **Output (PR-4c)** |
|---|---|---|
| Contract owner | the consumers (VAD/wake/ASR) | the **sink** = audio-output capability (playback device; later a remote client) |
| Bound by | the capture (never upsample) | the **sink's max** (the device); never upsample past it |
| Default (nothing in TOML) | derived | **CD — 44100 Hz / pcm16 / stereo** (the producer's *hint*) |
| Direction | conform capture **down** to canonical | conform producer **down** to the sink |
| Producer → consumer | capture → consumers | **TTS (+ others)** → sink |
| Format | pcm16 | **PCM only** (MP3/FLAC deferred to a distant future) |

**The model.** An **`AudioSink`** carries an `AudioContract` (its capability). The local-playback sink's contract
is the **active `audio` provider's `audio_contract()`** (e.g. `sounddevice` already declares `sample_rate=44100`,
`channels=2`), with an optional **`[audio]` override** (`output_rate`/`output_channels`) for operator determinism;
**CD** when neither specifies. `AudioNegotiator.to_sink(audio, sink_contract)` conforms **down-only** — pass the
producer through untouched when its rate/channels are `≤` the sink, downsample/downmix only when it *exceeds* the
sink ("any device plays lower"), **never upsample**. Same `AudioTranscoder` as `to_canonical`, recorded as an
`audio_output_conform` trace stage. **TTS** (and other producers) replace the ad-hoc `_conform_output_audio`
(which targets a per-request `audio_config`) with `core.audio_negotiator.to_sink(audio, sink)`.

**Locked decisions** — **D-8** output contract = the sink's audio capability; **D-9** default sink = CD
(44.1k/pcm16/stereo), the producer's hint; **D-10** sink contract = active audio provider's `audio_contract()`
+ optional `[audio]` override (CD default); **D-11** conform-**down-only** (pass-through `≤` sink); **D-12** PCM
only; **D-13** scope = **local playback now**, but `AudioSink` is a **generic abstraction** so remote/streaming
sinks (an ESP32/web client declaring its own contract in registration) are addable later with no rework.

(ARCH-15's *modality* negotiation — degrade-then-drop — is untouched; this is the finer audio-encoding layer
beneath it. Streaming-response audio keeps today's per-request handling until a streaming sink is added.)

**PR-4c slices:** (1) `audio_contract()` on the audio provider base (default CD) + `sounddevice` (from its
config); (2) `[audio]` `output_rate`/`output_channels` override fields (+ schema/master/config-ui); (3) a generic
`AudioSink` + `AudioNegotiator.to_sink` (conform-down + trace) + sink-contract resolution (provider + `[audio]`
override); (4) TTS uses `to_sink` (retire `_conform_output_audio`), traced; (5) tests; docs land in PR-6.

## 9. Hexagon seams (new vs reused)

- **New:** `AudioContract`, `AudioNegotiator` (logic), `VADProvider` (`providers/vad/base.py`),
  `irene.providers.vad`, the `[vad.providers.*]` schemas (auto_registry + config-ui get them like the QUAL-20
  WakeWordSpec work).
- **Reused/renamed:** `AudioTranscoder` (was `AudioProcessor`), `VoiceSegmenter` (was `UniversalAudioProcessor`),
  `trace_context` (ARCH-15), the entry-points discovery + single-active selection (`voice_trigger`).
- **Layer check:** `utils` stays leaf (`AudioTranscoder`/`AudioContract` have no upward deps — ARCH-12 holds);
  `VADProvider` is an adapter in `providers` (may reach `core` inward — silero pulls its asset path directly);
  `VoiceSegmenter` in `workflows` discovers/consumes them. No new backwards edges.

## 10. The live bug — folded in, not obsoleted

- `vad_implementation` validator (`models.py:457`, rejects `microvad`) → **deleted**; entry-points discovery
  is the source of "what engines exist," exactly like every other provider family.
- _(Re-reconciled during PR-2: the "unconditional `calibrate_threshold`" was **not** a live bug after all — the
  `VADEngine` ABC already defaults it to a no-op, so silero/microvad inherit it. It simply becomes the
  `VADProvider.calibrate` port method with a default no-op; energy opts in. So one real bug, not two.)_

Both are fixed *as a consequence* of the design (PR-2), so no separate patch is wasted.

## 11. Config shape

```toml
[vad]
enabled = true
default_provider = "energy"        # energy | silero | microvad (single-active)

[vad.providers.energy]
energy_threshold = 0.01
sensitivity = 0.5
# … the existing energy knobs

[vad.providers.silero]
threshold = 0.5
model_url = "…silero_vad.onnx"

[vad.providers.microvad]
threshold = 0.5

[audio]                            # optional canonical pin (else auto-derived)
# canonical_rate = 16000
# canonical_format = "pcm16"
```

The flat `silero_*` / `microvad_*` fields move under their provider; `vad_implementation` → `default_provider`.

## 12. Decisions (LOCKED 2026-06-10, design session)

- **D-1** Canonical transform-once; canonical **derived** (common denominator), config-pin optional, **fatal**
  if no canonical satisfies all parties.
- **D-2** VAD = **lightweight provider family** (port + providers + entry-points; no web/manager).
- **D-3** Contract scope = rate + channels + **sample-format** (int16/float32).
- **D-4** Transparency = **first-class trace events** + startup summary.
- **D-5** Names: `AudioTranscoder`, `VoiceSegmenter`, `AudioNegotiator`, `irene.providers.vad`.
- **D-6** **Symmetric** input+output through the one transcoder, both traced.
- **D-7** The 2 live bugs fold into PR-2.

## 13. Implementation slices (ARCH-18 unless noted)

1. **PR-1 — `AudioTranscoder` rename** (done 2026-06-10): rename `AudioProcessor` → `AudioTranscoder`
   everywhere (kills the `UniversalAudioProcessor` name collision). Behavior-preserving; pure rename.
   _Reconciliation:_ `AudioFormatConverter` turned out to be a **used, tested convenience layer** atop the
   engine (`convert_audio_data`/`_streaming` used internally + tested; `supports_format` used by the mic input),
   **not** the dead duplicate the original plan assumed — so its dissolution moved out of PR-1 (below).
2. **PR-2 — VAD provider family + `VoiceSegmenter`** (done 2026-06-10): `VADProvider` (`providers/vad/base.py`,
   adapter-port — *not* a separate `core/interfaces` port) + `energy`/`silero`/`microvad` providers wrapping the
   existing engines + entry-points + `[vad.providers.*]` config/schemas (config-ui via auto_registry, all 12
   configs nested); extract the if-else into the segmenter (discovery + energy fallback); `UniversalAudioProcessor`
   → `VoiceSegmenter` rename; the one real bug fixed (validator deleted). Done in 3 commits + the rename.
3. **PR-3 — `AudioContract` + `AudioNegotiator`** (done 2026-06-10): party-declared contracts —
   `audio_contract()` on the VAD / wake / ASR provider bases (capability), `AudioNegotiator.from_pipeline`
   gathers the **active providers'** contracts with the AUTHORITATIVE config rate as override; derive canonical
   + startup validation (fatal) + input transform-once at the `process_audio_input` boundary; `audio_negotiate`
   trace stage. **`AudioFormatConverter` folded + deleted** — its convert/streaming are now `AudioTranscoder`
   methods, `supports_format` relocated to the module fn `supports_audio_file_format`.
4. **PR-4** (PR-4a + 4b done 2026-06-10; **4c = symmetric output deferred to a design pass**):
   - **4a** — collapsed the 3 duplicated TTS resample blocks into one `TTSComponent._conform_output_audio`
     through the shared `AudioTranscoder`.
   - **4b** — input-side conformance done clean (the per-consumer resampling was untested zero-value code, not
     simply "redundant"): `asr.process_audio` + `voice_trigger.detect` now **trust canonical**; conformance
     happens once at each entry boundary — the mic pipeline via `to_canonical` (PR-3), the `/asr/transcribe`
     file upload via `_conform_to_rate`, and `/stream` requires canonical 16 kHz on the wire. Plus the §7
     **startup summary** now logs every party's contract (not a count). `AudioFormatConverter` already gone (PR-3).
   - **4c — symmetric output** (**DONE 2026-06-10, see §8**): sink-driven output contract
     (audio provider's `audio_contract()` + `[audio]` override, **CD default**), `AudioNegotiator.to_sink`
     conform-**down-only**, TTS retires `_conform_output_audio` for `to_sink` (traced), PCM-only, local-playback
     sink now with a generic `AudioSink` so streaming sinks are future-addable. Decisions D-8..D-13. _(Note: the
     input-path **endpoint unification** — shared `core.audio_negotiator`, `/asr/transcribe`→`to_canonical`,
     `/asr/stream`+`/asr/binary` deleted, `/ws/audio` already VAD-free — landed 2026-06-10 as a 4b follow-up.)_
5. **PR-5 — pre-roll contract** (done 2026-06-10): `VoiceSegmenter` sizes its pre-buffer lazily on the first
   frame as `ceil(detection_latency_ms(frame_ms) / frame_ms) + 2` from the **active VAD provider** at the REAL
   canonical frame duration — killing the magic `4` AND the 23-vs-25 ms/frame constants. Latency declaration
   harmonized: energy frame-count-based (scales with `frame_ms` → pre-roll = `voice_frames_required + 2`), silero
   `voice_duration_ms`, microvad a new `detection_latency_ms` TOML field. Also fixes energy being undersized for
   big capture chunks (4096 samples ≈ 93 ms, not the old assumed 25).
6. **PR-6 — user-facing docs + diagrams (END of ARCH-17/18)**: update `docs/guides/{vad,voice-trigger,audio}.md`
   and the architecture docs for the new component + negotiation seam; **re-author the affected dataflow/audio
   diagrams** in `docs/images/` (the mic→VAD→wake→ASR flow + the transform/negotiation seam — PNG/JPEG per the
   docs rules, no mermaid). This is the explicit final step, not an afterthought.

## 14. Relationships

- **ARCH-15** (`io_architecture.md`) — this is its input twin; shares `trace_context`, mirrors the negotiation
  shape (transform-or-error here vs degrade-then-drop there), and reuses the same `AudioTranscoder` for the
  output audio-encoding layer beneath ARCH-15's modality negotiation.
- **onnx_inference_layer.md §11.2** — **superseded**: the "small VAD seam" becomes this provider family.
- **ARCH-16** (deferred I/O daemon) — fits naturally: each input adapter declares its `AudioContract`; the
  negotiator derives canonical per pipeline at attach time.
- **QUAL-20** — the VAD provider family reuses the per-provider schema + config-ui pattern just built for wake
  words; `microvad`/`silero`/`energy` providers wrap the existing engines.
