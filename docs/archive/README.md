# Archived documentation (historical)

These documents are **point-in-time artifacts** from the v13 → v15 refactor: completed-phase reports,
implementation/design plans for work that has since shipped, one-off bug-fix writeups, and migration
guides for migrations that are already done. They are kept for history and rationale, but they do **not**
describe the current system and should not be treated as canonical reference.

For current, maintained documentation see:

- `../../README.md` — project overview
- `../architecture.md` — system architecture
- `../guides/` — audio, VAD, handler-development and donation reference guides
- `../../configs/config-master.toml` — the canonical, fully-commented configuration reference
