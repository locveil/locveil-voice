# Installing Irene on a Wirenboard controller

The controller runs prebuilt images pulled from the GitHub Container Registry — it never builds
anything. This directory is the whole deployment: a compose file, a short update script, and a
systemd unit. The pattern (and most of the muscle memory) is the same as the sibling
`locveil-bridge` deployment.

**Disk layout: the clone on the SD card is the delivery vehicle; `/mnt/data` holds the runtime
tree the container mounts** — the same split as the sibling bridge deployment:

```
/mnt/sdcard/locveil-voice/         <- this repo, cloned — touched ONLY by update.sh runs
/mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/       <- the RUNTIME tree: everything boot needs
├── docker-compose.yml             <- deployed here by update.sh (cp from the clone's ops/)
├── .env                           <- secrets (user-created; update.sh never touches it)
├── config/                        <- /app/config (read-only): irene.toml, delivered by
│                                     update.sh from the clone's profile TOML
├── assets/                        <- /app/assets: synced git-owned content (donations,
│                                     prompts, templates, localization) + downloaded speech
│                                     models, cache, traces, durable state (state/)
└── logs/                          <- /app/logs: irene.log + timestamped rotations
```

**The SD-card clone is needed only at update time; nothing the service needs at boot lives on
the card.** The card is a lazy automount (`x-systemd.automount`, slow to enumerate) — a unit
rooted on it dies at boot before the card appears (the bridge's reboot lesson, learned live).
So `update.sh` deploys: it copies the compose file and the profile config, and rsyncs the
git-owned assets subtrees from the clone into the runtime tree (and only those — models and
state are never touched); all compose commands then run from the runtime tree, where compose
also finds `.env`. `git pull` + `./update.sh` is how everything reaches the controller.
Docker's data-root is already configured on the controller (`/mnt/data/.docker`) and stays
where it is.

**The repo owns the config** (same rule as the bridge): `update.sh` overwrites
`config/irene.toml` from the clone's profile TOML on every update, and the mount is read-only
— edits made on the box don't stick, by design. Tune the config in the repo: edit the profile
TOML, commit, then `git pull` + `./update.sh` on the controller.

## Install

```sh
cd /mnt/sdcard
git clone https://github.com/locveil/locveil-voice.git
cd locveil-voice/ops
./update.sh            # creates + syncs the runtime tree, pulls images, starts the stack
```

Then wire it to boot — **copy** the unit, don't symlink it (a symlink onto the lazily-mounted
card would be unreadable to systemd at boot):

```sh
cp /mnt/sdcard/locveil-voice/ops/locveil-voice.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now locveil-voice
```

(Re-copy after a `git pull` if the unit file changed.)

The web API answers on port **8080** (`curl http://localhost:8080/health`). Speech models
download into the runtime tree's `assets/` on first boot — the first start takes a few
minutes; subsequent starts reuse them.

The container runs on the **host network**, like the bridge next to it. That is what lets the
assistant reach the bridge's REST API at `http://localhost:8000` to fetch the device catalog and
send commands: inside a port-mapped container, `localhost` means the container itself, not the
controller. It also means `:8080` is bound directly on the controller rather than published through
a mapping — so nothing else may already be listening there.

While that download runs, `docker compose ps` shows the container as **`health: starting`** —
its healthcheck polls `/health` and is given five minutes of grace before it starts reporting
`unhealthy`. On a slow link the first boot can outlast that; nothing restarts the container, so
just keep watching (`docker logs -f locveil-voice`) until the models land and it flips to
`healthy`. A container stuck `unhealthy` long after the models finished means the API never
bound — check the logs rather than the network.

## Secrets

Two optional cloud integrations read their keys from the container's environment; both degrade
cleanly to "off" when the key is absent (the assistant still runs fully offline):

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — the cloud LLM tier of intent recognition;
- `IRENE_REPORTS_TOKEN` — the GitHub token that lets spoken problem reports file themselves
  (fine-grained PAT for the private reports repo, Issues + Contents read/write).

Put them in a `.env` file in the **runtime tree**, next to the deployed compose file —
compose reads it automatically on both start paths (the systemd unit and `update.sh` run
compose from that directory):

```sh
cat > /mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/.env <<'EOF'
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXX
IRENE_REPORTS_TOKEN=github_pat_XXXXXXXX
EOF
chmod 600 /mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/.env
```

`update.sh` never touches this file. After adding or changing it, re-run `./update.sh` (or
`docker compose up -d` from the runtime tree).

## Update

```sh
cd /mnt/sdcard/locveil-voice
git pull
./ops/update.sh
```

`update.sh` re-syncs the git-owned assets subtrees (and **only** those — downloaded models and
runtime state are never touched), fixes ownership for the container user, pulls the newest
images, restarts the stack, and prunes old image layers to keep flash usage in check.

## Rolling back

Every published image also carries an immutable `vYYYYMMDD-<sha>` tag (see the package pages on
GHCR). Pin it in the **clone's** `ops/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
    image: ghcr.io/locveil/locveil-voice-armv7:v20260702-abc1234
```

then run `./ops/update.sh`. Return to `:latest` the same way.

Two rules make this work, and breaking either fails quietly rather than loudly:

- **Edit the clone's copy, never the deployed one.** `update.sh` copies `ops/docker-compose.yml`
  into the runtime tree on every run, so a pin written straight into
  `/mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/docker-compose.yml` is silently reverted to `:latest` at the next
  update. (Pinning leaves the clone dirty — commit it, or `git stash` before the next pull.)
- **Never run `docker compose` from the clone.** Compose names the project after the directory it
  runs in, so `docker compose up -d` inside `ops/` starts a *second* stack called `ops` beside the
  real one — and it finds no `.env` there, so that stack comes up with empty API keys. Run compose
  only from `/mnt/data/locveil-voice-config`, which is exactly what `update.sh` and the systemd unit
  do.

## Variants

The controller **remembers its profile**: pass `CONFIG_PROFILE` once and `update.sh` records it in
`/mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/config-profile`, so every later plain `./ops/update.sh` reuses it. An
unknown name aborts instead of delivering the wrong config.

- **aarch64 controller (WB8.5 / Pi)** — pin the aarch64 image
  (`ghcr.io/locveil/locveil-voice-aarch64`) in the clone's `ops/docker-compose.yml`, then run
  `CONFIG_PROFILE=embedded-aarch64 ./ops/update.sh` once. The armv7 defaults target the WB7.
- **English deployment** — same shape, with the `-en` image variant
  (`ghcr.io/locveil/locveil-voice-armv7-en` / `-aarch64-en`) and the matching
  `CONFIG_PROFILE=embedded-armv7-en` (resp. `-aarch64-en`); language is baked into the image.

The image and the profile must agree: the profile names the models the image actually ships.

The configuration editor (config-ui) is **not deployed on the controller** — the repo owns the
config here, so editing happens repo-side; run config-ui on a workstation against a dev
backend when you want the visual editor.

## Satellite TLS plane (optional)

Room satellites that connect over mutual TLS (`wss://`) need the fleet-provisioning plane —
nginx + a tiny home CA serving the certificate bootstrap and the mTLS gate. It deliberately
runs **outside** this container, directly on the controller (security-critical PKI must not
depend on Irene being up). It is deployed separately, via ansible — see
[`nginx/README.md`](../nginx/README.md) for the design, the operator runbook
(`esp32-provision approve …`) and the deploy playbook. One wiring point connects the two
planes: set `esp32_irene_upstream: 127.0.0.1:8080` in the nginx `group_vars` so `/ws/audio*`
proxies to the container installed here. Satellites on a trusted network can skip all of this
and connect over plain `ws://` directly to :8080.

## Recovery notes

- The container is stateless: removing it (or the image) loses nothing — everything that matters
  lives in the runtime tree and the git clone.
- **An SD card death (or a boot without the card) costs nothing.** The service boots and runs
  entirely from `/mnt/data` — the card only carries the clone, needed at update time. To
  restore updates: re-clone and re-run `./update.sh`; secrets (`.env`) and the whole runtime
  tree are on `/mnt/data`, untouched.
- A corrupted model download can be deleted from
  `/mnt/data/locveil-voice-config/assets/models/…`; it re-downloads on the next start.
- Memory: the compose file caps Irene at 800 MB — if the assistant is OOM-killed on a busy
  controller, check `docker stats` and tune the cap (the ASR/TTS models are the big consumers).
