# Irene — Release Plan

The single active tracker for the road to release. Supersedes the legacy `docs/TODO.md` +
`docs/TODO/TODO0x` (refactor-era, mostly complete — to be archived under DOC-2).

**Target:** _TBD_ · **Status:** reviving (paused ~Sep 2025, restarted May 2026) · **Version:** 15.0.0

> **Completed tasks** (`[x]`) live in the frozen archive **[`RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md`](./RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md)** —
> split out to keep this file the *active* working set (open tasks + structure). IDs are preserved there; grep it
> when a reference or reconciliation (`task-start-reconciliation`) needs the detail of a closed task.

## Definition of release (exit criteria) — _draft, refine_

> **Scope gate (`single-task-ledger`):** release ships only when **every task tagged `[release]` is `[x]`**. Tasks default to
> `[release]` unless explicitly marked `[deferred]` (post-release). Run `scripts/check_scope.py` at each gate to prove
> nothing has drifted (orphan findings, dead links, contradictory status). The exit criteria below are the
> human-readable summary of that gate.

- [ ] Clean `uv sync`; boots in CLI **and** WebAPI modes on x86_64, and as a Docker image.
- [ ] CI green (re-enabled, current action versions).
- [ ] No phantom-reference / runtime `NameError` bugs; pyright (standard) at/under an agreed threshold.
- [ ] Import layering honored: no real cycles, no backwards cross-layer imports per an agreed contract.
- [ ] Test suite runs and passes; coverage understood.
- [ ] Models point to current versions with live download URLs.
- [ ] Docs accurate at the release version; quickstart works end-to-end.
- [ ] **`config-ui` builds (`tsc && vite build`), type-checks clean, and is functional against the release backend.**

## Invariants (apply to EVERY task)

**The invariants now live in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) → “Development process — invariants”** (single source
of truth, always in context). They are referenced by **name** (stable slug), not number — e.g.
`single-task-ledger`, `task-start-reconciliation`, `read-at-start-record-at-completion`. Frozen archives and
review docs still cite the old `#N`; the number→name legend is in `CLAUDE.md`.

## How to use this file

- **Workstreams** are stable buckets. **Tasks** are the unit of work — sized to one coherent commit/PR,
  with a stable ID (referenced in commit messages, e.g. `ARCH-1: …`).
- Status: `- [ ]` open · `- [x]` done · `- [~]` paused/partial · annotate `BLOCKED`/`DEFERRED`/`DOING` + reason inline. Priority `P0–P2`.
- **On completion, a task moves** out of this file into **[`RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md`](./RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md)** (frozen,
  by workstream) — flip its status, cut the block here, paste it under its workstream there, in the same change as the
  journal entry. This file holds only **open + paused/partial** tasks so it stays small and readable.
- Individual lint findings live in the review docs (e.g. `docs/review/phase0_static_baseline.md`) and
  **roll up** into a task here — keep this file a spine, not a dumping ground.
- **This file = scope + status only.** Record what happened / decisions in **`RELEASE_JOURNAL.md`** (`one-active-journal`).
  Tag each task **`[release]`** or **`[deferred]`**; the release gate is "every `[release]` task `[x]`" (`single-task-ledger`).

## Sequencing (phased roadmap — decided 2026-06-01)

The review wave (QUAL-8/10/12/14) is done. Its P0s are **not one species**: some are *surgical bug fixes*
(architecture-independent), some are *refactor-flavored* (they ARE subsystem architecture work). They sequence
differently. Key constraint: **there is no test safety net right now** (TEST-2 paused; full rewrite = TEST-7 later),
and the structural refactors **move code** — so blind refactoring/fixing is the main risk. Phases:

- **Gate 0 — verification net + cheap guard (do FIRST, before touching structure):**
  - **TEST-0** — a minimal end-to-end smoke harness (boot + a few real flows: command→intent, set a timer, extract
    a parameter). Small refactor safety net, **distinct from the TEST-7 rewrite**. It's the "wire-up integration
    test" all four reviews said is missing — would have caught every review P0.
  - **QUAL-23** — the startup-assertion ("every configured provider/stage/action name resolves to something real").
    Cheap; catches 3 of 4 review P0 *classes* (cascade names, console provider, dead stages) and stops regressions.
- **Gate 1 — structural foundation:** **ARCH-1** (split god-module) → **ARCH-2** (config↔core cycle) →
  **ARCH-4** (formalize ports) → **ARCH-5** (import-linter; folds in QUAL-23). **DOC-4** in parallel (pin the target).
  **✓ COMPLETE 2026-06-02.**
- **Gate 1.5 — dataflow review + reconciliation. ✓ COMPLETE 2026-06-02.** **QUAL-25** (full input→action flow map +
  defect hunt → `dataflow_review.md`, ~9 P0/~20 P1) → **QUAL-26** (review-of-reviews, live: 10 intended-vs-today
  decisions + finalized Gate 2 framing → `dataflow_reconciliation.md`). Surfaced a 4th cross-cutting theme
  (data-contract integrity) and emitted QUAL-27..31.
- **Gate 2 — the cross-cutting systemic remediation + review P0s (downstream of Gate 1.5; framing per QUAL-26):**
  - **Cross-cutting principles** (the lens; full text in the QUAL section): **① fail-loud** · **② shared bases** ·
    **③ config-truth (deployment-aware)** · **④ data-contract integrity**.
  - **Foundational tasks first:** **QUAL-27** (data-contract fixes; ✓ DONE) + **QUAL-28** (context & action-store
    refactor; ✓ DONE 2026-06-02) as the structural base → **QUAL-29** (donation format split; precedes declarative
    device-resolution) remains.
  - **Per-subsystem on top:** **QUAL-9** [FAF], **QUAL-11** [PEX], **QUAL-13** [TXTPROC], **QUAL-15** [LLM],
    **QUAL-16** [PROMPTS], **QUAL-22**, **QUAL-23** + **QUAL-30** (clarification Grade 1).
  - **Later / design-gated:** **QUAL-31** (slot-filling feature) · **ARCH-6** (WS ESP32 input) + **ARCH-7** (output
    seam / MQTT) design sessions · **DOC-7/DOC-8**.

**One-line rule:** *fix the data contracts and the context split first; the per-subsystem P0s ride that foundation.*

## Workstreams

### Architecture & Refactor (ARCH)
Target pattern: **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** — SIGNED OFF 2026-06-01. Code is already ~80% there
(interfaces=ports, providers=adapters, components=app services, entry-points=registry).
See `docs/review/phase1_architecture_map.md` §5.
- [ ] **ARCH-8** [MQTT] (P-TBD) — **★ ARCH-22 (2026-06-14):** the **voice-confirmation of actuation** feature (T-B,
      `docs/design/esp32_satellite.md` §10) rides this task — a sequenced `DEVICE_COMMAND → bridge rich DeliveryResult →
      derive text → SPEECH to the origin device` (opt-in `confirm_actuation_by_voice`; device-transparent, reply via
      ARCH-21). Implement it with ARCH-8's rich `DeliveryResult`. **★ Catalog contract amended 2026-06-15:** the bridge's
      `/system/catalog` now projects controllable enum fields' `values` as `{wire, canonical, labels}` triplets (bridge
      §P3.7 #26) — ARCH-8's `DeviceCatalog` parses them and device-enum resolution rides the **QUAL-29 surface→canonical**
      path (`labels`=surfaces, `canonical`=token; bridge translates `canonical`→`wire`). See `mqtt_integration.md` §5a.
      _Orig:_ **UNBLOCKED 2026-06-06** (contract AGREED); **RECONCILED with the I/O architecture
      2026-06-07 (ARCH-15 PR-9.1) — build against `mqtt_integration.md` §13**: bridge actuation is a **request/response
      `OutputPort`** returning the rich `DeliveryResult` (echo/error), `device_command` is a delivery **modality**
      capability-routed to the `designate(DEVICE_COMMAND,"bridge")` output, `DeviceCatalogPort` stays a read port, Flow-1
      event is a terminal `OutputPort`; the `ActuationPort` ABC is **dropped** (the bridge IS an OutputPort). ARCH-8 thus
      stands on PR-2 (`OutputPort`/`DeliveryResult`), PR-5a (process-wide OutputManager), D-2 (designated routing) — all
      landed; actuation is observable on the event bus (PR-6b) for free. Implement per
      `docs/design/mqtt_integration.md` §10 **as amended by §13**, against the agreed bridge contract, aligned to the **vertical slice**
      ("включи свет в детской", one `wb-mr6c` channel): **PR-1** `DeviceCommand` + `ActuationPort`/`DeviceCatalogPort` +
      application services (adapter-free, fake bridge — **can start now**); **PR-2** `BridgeClient` REST adapter +
      `irene.providers.outputs` group + config/schema + `GET /system/catalog` pull → `DeviceCatalog` + `bridge/catalog/
      version` subscribe; **PR-3** wire `DeviceCatalog` into `DeviceEntityResolver` (real device/room entities, ru-name
      match — ARCH-6 device-half, with QUAL-35); **PR-4** reference device handler end-to-end (`power.on` → canonical →
      echo → spoken confirm + error-code→speech + `param_invalid`→clarify); **PR-5** sensor read (`GET /devices/{id}/state`).
      (No "everywhere" fan-out — "выключи свет везде" = an Actuate against the `global` `all_lights` aggregate device, on
      PR-4's path.) PR-2+ integrate as the bridge's slice comes online. Broad
      device coverage + T2/T3 NLU = QUAL-35. **★ ARCH-26 (2026-07-01):** catalog refresh is **lazy** (no MQTT client on
      Irene — §5a/§14); PR-1's fake bridge **is** the capturing `OutputPort` the producer contract test (TEST-18) uses;
      PR-2/PR-3 catalog parsing builds against the committed contract artifact (**TEST-17**, gated on bridge **VWB-15**).
- [ ] **ARCH-16** [IO] (P-deferred) — **I/O daemon multiplexer + runners→thin presets (deferred ARCH-15 PR-10).**
      The I/O hexagon (ARCH-15) is complete and every channel runs; this is the internal-cleanliness endgame, deferred
      2026-06-07 as low-incremental-value / higher-risk. Scope: (a) **remote interactive text-attach channel** (e.g.
      `/ws/cli` — attach a debug-CLI from a notebook, text in/out, routed through the workflow + OutputManager,
      origin-paired; the *reproduce* half of the operator scenario, pairing with the PR-6b `/ws/observe` *observe* half) —
      the highest-value, low-risk piece, additive + testable; (b) **runners → thin config-preset launchers** over **one
      daemon multiplexer** that consumes all active input sources concurrently (generalising PR-5b's CLI consume loop) +
      **runtime attach/detach** (§4/§8) — fuses the CLI/webapi/vosk shapes; the larger, riskier refactor (low e2e
      coverage on interactive paths). Also carries the small ARCH-15 follow-ons: **PR-6c web-app JS** (open `/ws/output`,
      thread `client_id` into POSTs, render pushed frames — web-template edit) and **PR-7 capability-matrix display**
      (read-only outputs×modalities). Refs: `io_architecture.md` §4/§8/§12 (PR-10), ARCH-15, ARCH-6.
- [ ] **ARCH-23** [ESP32] (P-TBD) `[deferred]` — **ESP32 firmware rewrite (ESP-IDF + PlatformIO).** Build the headless
      voice-satellite firmware to the ARCH-22 contract (**`docs/design/esp32_satellite.md`**), replacing the quarantined
      `ESP32/firmware/` draft (rev 2, inspiration only — its protocol predates the backend; UI/output/codec are stubs). Per
      D-1..D-18: board + digital I2S mic + MAX98357A speaker, half-duplex (D-2/D-7); ESP-IDF/PlatformIO not Arduino (D-3);
      the wire protocol §4 (register → PCM → `{"type":"end"}`; reply channel `speak_begin`/PCM/`speak_end`); ported
      microWakeWord on `esp-tflite-micro` with the **TFLite-Micro micro-features frontend** + µVAD (D-9, NOT the draft's
      MFCC/energy VAD); models in a flash data-partition, runtime-loaded (D-12); two-stage SoftAP→STA provisioning + the
      device admin UI + CSR submission (D-16/D-17, against Plane-B `nginx/`); config-preserving OTA (D-18). Likely a separate
      firmware repo eventually (per `esp32_wakeword_review.md` quarantine). Substantial standalone C++ effort; tracked here so
      it's not an orphan finding. Depends on hardware selection finalised (mic/speaker parts) + the Plane-B controller deploy.
- [ ] **ARCH-25** [INFER][HW] (P-TBD) `[release]` — **Satellite hardware bring-up — WB7 (armv7) + WB8.5 (aarch64)
      on-device re-validation.** The single convergence point for the hardware-gated verification the software tasks defer
      here (split out of **ARCH-10** 2026-06-16, now implementation-complete). Deploy the `embedded-armv7` /
      `embedded-aarch64` images (**BUILD-3**) on the real boxes and confirm the satellite stack boots and serves
      end-to-end: **(1)** container boots, web API on :6000, baked config + mounted assets-root resolve; **(2)** sherpa-onnx
      ASR runs at acceptable **RTF/latency** on the A7/A53 (vosk-small on WB7, whisper-small on WB8.5) with RU parity;
      **(3)** the **ESP32 server-authoritative streaming endpoint** (ARCH-10, built + seam-tested) validates on device —
      real `OnlineRecognizer` endpoint RTF/latency over `/ws/audio` `mode:"streaming"`; **(4)** Piper / `piper_ruaccent`
      TTS synthesis + the SPEECH reply rides back to the ESP32 over the reply channel; **(5)** wake-word/microVAD `.tflite`
      coverage on aarch64 (QUAL-19/20). Absorbs the boot / on-device remainders that **ARCH-24** + **BUILD-3** point here,
      and gates **Definition-of-release item #1**. User/hardware-gated — no CI surrogate. Refs:
      `torch_free_armv7_voice.md`, `esp32_satellite.md` §4.4/§12, BUILD-3, ARCH-10.

### Code Quality & Review (QUAL)
- [ ] **QUAL-60** [INTENTS][LLM] (P3) `[deferred]` — **Summarize-then-truncate for the LLM conversation window
      (BUG-18 follow-up; user chose "window now + file summarization" 2026-07-02).** BUG-18 bounds the conversation
      store with a plain rolling window (last `max_context_length` turns; seed system prompt pinned) — older context
      is simply forgotten. This task adds continuity for long conversations: when the window overflows, compress the
      dropped turns into a pinned summary message via one LLM call. Needs: a Russian-capable summarization prompt
      (localized, prompt-asset-driven like the handler's other prompts), a fallback to plain windowing when the LLM
      call fails/times out, and a decision on re-summarization cadence (every overflow vs. every K overflows). Seam:
      `ConversationIntentHandler._trim_llm_context` / `UnifiedConversationContext.trim_handler_messages` — the trim
      call is already the single choke point, so summarization slots in front of it without touching call sites.
      _Filed 2026-07-02 from BUG-18._
- [ ] **QUAL-18** [STREAMAPI] (P-TBD) — Act on QUAL-17 (per `streaming_api_review.md` §5): **(1)** vendor + wire the
      official `@asyncapi/web-component` at `/asyncapi`, delete the bespoke renderer (≈ −900 LOC); **(2)** fix the
      lossy `_clean_property_for_asyncapi` union/nullable handling; **(3, scoped separately)** emit AsyncAPI 3.0 +
      binary message bindings for ESP32 frames; **(4)** retire/repoint the docstring `x-` extension parser.


#### Cross-cutting systemic remediation — principles (the Gate 2 lens)
_Apply to every remediation task below (from the 4 review docs + QUAL-25/26). Source: `dataflow_reconciliation.md`._
- **① Fail-loud** — raise structured exceptions → catch at ONE handler/orchestrator boundary → typed
  `IntentResult(success=False, error=…)`; **never swallow, guess a default, or return-original-on-failure.** The
  user-facing form is a **conversational clarification** (explain + ask), not an error dump; missing-required and
  no-intent both clarify. Backed by a **donation-driven typed accessor** (one place enforces required-vs-optional).
- **② Shared bases** — one NLU extraction base (donation-`ParameterSpec`-driven), one LLM prompt source (= the
  LLM-independent hardening layer), one normalization seam (contains the `lingua_franca`/`Runorm` debt), one F&F
  write-back, one result-construction contract. No copy-paste-then-diverge.
- **③ Config-truth (deployment-aware)** — every key is schema-known with **no dead trees** (consumed by *some*
  codepath in *some* profile) **and** every *enabled* component/provider/stage resolves to real code. `config-master`
  is a valid curated **superset**; deployment configs are minimal subsets — the check must not flag the superset.
- **④ Data-contract integrity** — a model field means **one thing end-to-end**; no rename residue
  (`Intent.text`/`raw_text`, `WakeWordResult.word`/`wake_word`, action key `action_name`/`domain`, session scope).
- [ ] **QUAL-35** `[release]` [PEX][MQTT] (P-TBD) — **★ ARCH-22 (2026-06-14) supplies the multi-room resolution SPEC
      (D-15, `docs/design/esp32_satellite.md`):** no room → primary; a covered room in the utterance → that room; a known
      (catalog) room NOT covered → spoken error "this room is not managed by this device". Needs the bridge catalog
      (ARCH-8) for the global room set + RU-morphology room matching. ARCH-22 already **carries** `primary_room`/
      `covered_rooms` on `ClientRegistration` (D-14); this task implements the resolver that consumes them. _Orig:_
      **Declarative NLU tiers T2 + T3 — MUST-HAVE for smart-home/MQTT
      (gated on ARCH-7/8). Split out of QUAL-11 (2026-06-03, user).** _ARCH-15 PR-9.2 note: the device handlers QUAL-35
      authors **emit a `device_command`-modality result delivered via the OutputManager to the designated bridge
      `OutputPort`** and await its rich `DeliveryResult` (echo/error → spoken confirm; `param_invalid` → clarify) — per
      `mqtt_integration.md` §13 (ARCH-8). No bespoke ActuationPort._ QUAL-11 deliberately shipped the **lightweight (T1)**
      extraction contract — keyword/NER + regex + CHOICE surfaces + lemmas, which is what the `hybrid_keyword_matcher`
      (the hot path) actually runs. T1 covers the easy ~80% of commands but **fails on the complex commands smart-home
      control needs.** This task builds the two heavier tiers when MQTT/smart-home lands:
      • **T2 — spaCy `Matcher`/`EntityRuler` slot-filling** (the currently-**parked** `token_patterns`/`slot_patterns`/
        `extraction_patterns`, authored across all 14 handlers but validated-then-discarded today). Implement in the
        **spaCy provider as the cascade fallback** (lemma/POS-aware recognition + span→`ParameterSpec` slot extraction).
        Wins where T1 provably fails: **compound values** ("таймер на 2 часа 30 минут" → 150 min, not 2), **two
        same-type entities by role/preposition** ("со спальни **на** кухню" → source vs dest), **multiple param=value
        pairs in any order** ("яркость 30 и температуру 22"), **free-text spans into a slot** ("напомни выключить
        плиту"), and **morphology/name-collisions at real-home scale** (`{LEMMA: лампа}` vs `{LEMMA: лампочка}`,
        deterministic vs fuzzy). _Stop the silent validate-then-discard now (QUAL-11 Stage C documents the patterns as
        parked here)._
      • **T3 — dependency-parse / local-LLM NLU** for what T2 **also** can't do (linear Matcher has no scope):
        **negation/exceptions** ("все лампы **кроме** торшера"), **anaphora** ("сделай **его** поярче"), **conditionals**
        ("**если** темно, включи свет"). Ties to the local-LLM-assist lane (QUAL-15) + ARCH-9/10 [INFER]; opt-in,
        local-only.
      **Sequencing:** design with **ARCH-7** (MQTT/output-port + room/device model) and land before/with **ARCH-8**
      (smart-home actuation) — complex device commands are unusable on T1 alone. **OWNS the device-half relocated
      from ARCH-6 (2026-06-03):** ARCH-6 deferred the `entity_type`/`room_context` *consumption* because at its build
      time NO device/room handlers existed (all decls `generic`) — that work lives HERE, where the device handlers do.
      So this task: **(a)** authors the non-generic `entity_type`/`room_context` (device/location/room/person) on the
      smart-home handlers it builds; **(b)** replaces the brittle `_is_device_entity`/`_is_location_entity` name-heuristics
      (`entity_resolver.py`) with declarative `entity_type`-driven resolver selection (the Q7b "typed accessor IS the
      replacement" atomic swap); **(c)** implements the `room_context` resolve-or-clarify policy (with QUAL-30). ARCH-6
      left the seam ready (`resolve_physical_id` returns the registered physical id; `ClientRegistry` populated by the WS
      handshake). Gated by `config-ui-stays-functional` (any donation-schema change → config-ui;
      note the parked T2 pattern fields already exist, so no new schema surface unless extended). Refs:
      `parameter_extraction_review.md` (T2 = the "dead best mechanisms" themes 1+3), QUAL-11 (T1 baseline), Q6/Q7.
      • **★ Units-of-measurement layer (design WITH this task — user, 2026-06-28).** Smart-home commands carry units
        (dimming **%**, climate **°C**, …), the same value+unit shape time already needs. BUG-6 consolidated the **time**
        family into `irene/utils/units.py` (`TIME_UNITS` table + `parse_duration`) and **removed the dead `DURATION`
        param-type stub** (it never had a `coerce()` branch). Do NOT build a general units abstraction speculatively —
        design it HERE, against the real device-unit requirements: generalize `units.py` to a value+unit type with
        **canonical normalization + externalized (donation/catalog) unit surfaces** so timer + dimming + temperature
        share ONE path. The bridge catalog (ARCH-8) declares each device's unit — that's the requirement source.
        `QuantityEntityResolver` (`entity_resolver.py`) already holds the non-time nucleus (percent/degrees). _(The ru
        oblique-case numeral gap noted here was resolved separately as BUG-7.)_
- [ ] **QUAL-44** `[deferred]` [DFLOW] (P2, enhancement; split from QUAL-31) — **Answer-vs-new-command arbitration on a
      clarifying turn.** QUAL-31's resume pre-check (`workflows/voice_assistant.py` `_process_pipeline`, the
      `take_pending_clarification` branch) **unconditionally** treats the turn that follows a clarification as the answer:
      it prepends the original utterance and re-runs NLU on the combined text. That is the intended flow ("answer with
      just the missing value"), but if the user instead **abandons the clarification and barks a new command** ("какая
      погода?" after being asked a timer duration), the combine yields a garbled utterance ("поставь таймер какая
      погода?") that can misroute or no-op. Today this is bounded only by one-shot consumption (the bad turn clears the
      marker) + idle-window expiry — acceptable for the P2 feature, but not robust. **Scope:** add deterministic
      arbitration before combining — e.g. run NLU on the **bare answer first**; if it independently recognizes as a
      **confident, non-fallback** intent (a real, different command), drop the pending clarification and process the
      answer **fresh**; otherwise (bare fragment / low-confidence / fallback) treat it as the slot answer and combine as
      today. **Trade-off to settle:** an extra NLU pass on clarifying turns only (cheap, rare) vs. a lighter
      confidence/phrase heuristic; also decide whether a brand-new command should *cancel* the pending intent silently or
      acknowledge the abandonment. Pairs with QUAL-31 (this is its known limitation) and the F&F `contextual` resolution
      (same "is this turn about the prior context or a fresh request?" question). Done when a new-command answer routes
      to the new command (not the garbled combine) with a regression test, and the legitimate slot-answer path stays
      green. Refs: QUAL-31, QUAL-30, Q7.
- [ ] **QUAL-53** [NLU] (P3) `[deferred]` — **Trace-driven improvement of the cheap NLU tiers** (split from QUAL-51,
      2026-06-16). When an utterance falls through to the LLM classifier, that's a signal the cheap deterministic tiers
      (keyword matcher, spaCy) *should* have caught it. Build an **offline analysis process, integrated with trace
      playback**, that examines such fall-throughs and proposes concrete fixes — donation phrases/patterns, spaCy config,
      keyword/fuzzy thresholds — so the cheap layers catch more and the LLM is reserved for genuine fuzz. **Prerequisite
      (real gap found 2026-06-16):** the NLU cascade trace currently records only the **final** result
      (`nlu_component.py` `record_stage("nlu_cascade")`), not each provider's attempt/confidence — so it can't yet explain
      *why* a fall-through happened. First enrich the cascade trace to record per-provider attempts (which tried, each
      one's confidence, why it abstained), then build the analyzer over recorded traces. Needs real usage data → deferred.
- [ ] **QUAL-55** [APICONTRACT] (P2) `[release]` — **One canonical `WorkflowResult → API` serializer across the five
      execution surfaces.** `docs/review/api_result_contract_review.md` found the same result is hand-serialized 5 ways
      (REST `/execute/command|audio`, `/trace/command|audio`, WS `/ws/audio`): reply text is `response` vs `text` (F1),
      `CommandResponse` carries two different metadata payloads (F3), `confidence` placement differs (F4), intent exposure
      diverges (F2 — WS half fixed in QUAL-54). Introduce a single serializer (`text`/`success`/`confidence`/`intent_name`
      + normalized metadata) and route all five through it; retires F1/F3/F4 + the rest of F2. **Renames response fields →
      `config-ui-stays-functional` co-change** (`apiClient.ts`, `src/types/*`). Filed 2026-06-27 from the review.

### Bugs (BUG)
_Discrete functional defects (distinct from QUAL refactors/quality work). Surfaced from any source; filed before fixing._


- [ ] **BUG-5** [NLU/I18N/DONATION] (P3) `[deferred]` — **Donation en files missing user-facing translations
      (recognition enrichment).** The translation audit (under BUG-4) found Russian donation files richer than English:
      ~28 params across 13 handlers have RU `aliases` (param-name synonyms) with no EN equivalent, and ~9 params have
      RU `choice_surfaces` with no EN. These are **recognition enrichment** (en already works via method phrases +
      patterns; missing aliases just mean fewer en synonyms), not a functional break — so split out from BUG-4.
      **Respect `donation-choice-surfaces-rule`:** add EN synonyms for user-facing *concepts* (e.g. `duration` →
      "time"/"for", `message` → "reminder"), but **NEVER** "translate" canonical technical identifiers (provider /
      model / driver / service names are self-matchable). Per-handler gap list in the BUG-4 audit. Surfaced while
      fixing BUG-4.

### Tests (TEST)
> **Strategy (decided 2026-06-01): do NOT keep repairing the existing suite.** Most tests were written against
> pre-refactor code and will be invalidated by the ARCH refactors (ARCH-1..5) and the code reviews (QUAL-8/10/12/14).
> Fixing them now is throwaway work. The TEST-1/TEST-2 pass already extracted the real value — it **proved the suite
> runs** and surfaced concrete prod findings (QUAL-21, QUAL-22, the text_processor trace fix). The current state
> (166 pass / 56 fail / 13 skip / 2 xfail, all committed) stands as a **partial safety net**; the remaining 56
> failures are left **intentionally unfixed**. The real test effort is **TEST-7: rewrite the suite after the
> architecture + code reviews land** (gated). TEST-3/4/5/6 are coverage goals folded into that rewrite.

_Trace-driven system testing (design `docs/design/trace_system_testing.md`, TEST-11 ✓) — all implementation slices
(TEST-12/13/14/15) done; see `RELEASE_PLAN_DONE.md`._

- [ ] **TEST-17** [EVAL][MQTT] (P3) `[deferred]` — **The Irene↔bridge catalog contract bundle in eval-commons (ARCH-26
      §14).** A committed, shared artifact both repos pin so each builds against the boundary with no live counterpart:
      (a) the bridge's FastAPI **`/openapi.json`** pinned (carries **both** `CatalogResponse` and the canonical
      action-request body — no bespoke schema); (b) a **curated golden catalog** ("the works" — rooms, device classes,
      `global`/`all_lights` aggregates, every capability incl. sensor-read, `{wire,canonical,labels}` enum triplets,
      param schemas, localized ru/en names/aliases); (c) a **real WB7 catalog dump** as a realism check; (d) the
      canonical `DeviceCommand` schema + a set of **`{utterance → expected canonical command}` crossover fixtures** both
      sides test against; (e) a **schema-validation/drift check**. **This task owns the one-way sync:** it pins a copy of
      the bridge's committed reference artifacts into `eval-commons/contracts/` (with a version stamp naming the bridge
      commit) — the bridge does **not** write into eval-commons (§14 publish boundary). Unblocks ARCH-8 PR-1/PR-3 (build
      the `DeviceCatalog` + resolver offline). **Gated on VWB-15** (bridge emits + commits the openapi + golden/real
      samples in its own repo). Doubles as the eval `mqtt`/`http` seed. Design §14; pairs with TEST-18.
- [ ] **TEST-18** [EVAL][MQTT] (P3) `[deferred]` — **The `device_command` capture provider + Irene producer contract
      tests (ARCH-26 §14).** A new eval-commons promptfoo provider that drives Irene with an utterance and returns the
      emitted canonical `DeviceCommand` (captured by the PR-1 capturing bridge `OutputPort`, not POSTed) for assertion
      against the TEST-17 crossover fixtures + openapi schema — the **producer** half of the bidirectional contract
      (the bridge's consumer half = VWB-16). **Text-input first** (isolates NLU→resolver→handler, deterministic, no
      audio/bridge); audio→canonical later. **Gated on ARCH-8 PR-1** (supplies `DeviceCommand` + the capturing output)
      **and TEST-17.** Design §14.

### Build & CI (BUILD)
### Internationalization (I18N)
_Real English deployment across all three Docker arches (armv7/aarch64/x86_64) + English eval. Design
`docs/design/multilingual_deployment.md` (I18N-1 ✓) → the implementation slices below. English models are slim and
size-matched to the Russian stack; language is a per-config/deployment choice (auto-detect is NOT wired to ASR/TTS)._

### Models & Assets (ASSET)

### Documentation (DOC)
- [ ] **DOC-8** (P1) — **Data & context-models map** → `docs/guides/DATA_MODELS.md`. **Downstream of QUAL-25
      [DFLOW]** (re-categorized 2026-06-02): this is the *write-up* that distills the dataflow **review** into a
      concise developer reference; the investigation/findings now live in QUAL-25 → `docs/review/dataflow_review.md`.
      Do this **after** QUAL-25 lands, consuming its map + confirmed model lifecycle. A concise reference for how
      the pipeline's models play together — **when each is needed and why** (the request-scoped vs session-scoped
      distinction is the key confusion to resolve). Cover the cast + responsibilities: **`RequestContext`**
      (per-*request* input metadata — source, session_id, wants_audio, skip flags, client/room/device, language;
      created at the entry by the runner/web/cli) · **`UnifiedConversationContext`** (persistent per-*session* state
      — history, active/recent/failed actions, devices, `ConversationState`, `ContextLayer`; keyed by `session_id`,
      fetched via `ContextManager`) · **`Intent`** (NLU output) · **`IntentResult`** (handler output) ·
      **`AudioData`/`WakeWordResult`** (IO primitives). Document the **lifecycle**: `RequestContext` →
      `ContextManager.get_context(session_id)` → `UnifiedConversationContext` → `NLU → Intent` →
      `orchestrator.execute → IntentResult` → `context.add_to_history(...)`. State where each now lives post-ARCH-1/5
      (`intents/context_models.py`, `intents/models.py`, `utils/audio_data.py`). DOC-4 links to it. Refs:
      `phase1_architecture_map.md` §4.

### UI / config-ui (UI)
React/Vite donation+config editor. Front-end feature/UX work (the BUILD-4 build gate stays under Build & CI).
Governed by `config-ui-stays-functional` (config-ui must stay functional).
- [ ] **UI-4** [WORKFLOWVIZ] (P-deferred) — A config-ui **"Workflow Control" / pipeline-visualization page** (live
      React-Flow DAG of the component/provider pipeline, per-stage input/output inspection, provider switching, SSE
      updates). **Source design archived** at `docs/archive/workflow_control.md` (Sep-2025, never built). **Strongly
      gated — do NOT start before Gate 2:** the design assumes a clean pipeline, but QUAL-25 proved the real dataflow
      is broken at many hops (visualizing it now would faithfully render broken flow), and it specs `/workflow/*`
      endpoints that `architecture.md` §7 flags as **fictional** (they'd have to be built for real). Relates to the
      `MonitoringPage` placeholder and the **ARCH-7 [MQTT]** output-seam work (both touch live pipeline observability).
      Re-scope against the *fixed* pipeline + real endpoints when it's actually picked up. Captured from a config-ui
      doc reviewed during QUAL-25 (2026-06-02).
- [ ] **UI-15** [UI] (P3) `[deferred]` — **★ DESIGN — donation blocking-conflict resolution** (`design-then-implement`;
      user chose "build real resolution" when triaging BUG-10, 2026-06-28). BUG-10 made `BlockingConflictsDialog`
      reachable **read-only** (a "Review blocking conflicts" trigger; no Resolve buttons). This task designs+builds the
      real thing: define what *resolving/overriding* a blocking NLU conflict means in the donations editor (override-to-
      save? jump-to-edit the conflicting method/param? apply a suggested fix then re-validate?), then implement
      `BlockingConflictsDialog.onResolve` + the gating change that lets save proceed once blockers are resolved/overridden
      (today `canSaveNLU` hard-requires `!hasBlockingConflicts`). Deliverable: a design doc under `docs/design/` first,
      then implementation follow-up(s). The inline `ValidationIndicator` already surfaces blockers, so scope the modal's
      added value deliberately (resolution UX, not just a second display).
- [ ] **UI-16** [UI] (P3) `[deferred]` — **config-ui schema-driven sections/widgets + spaCy-attr i18n** (review §E
      altitude; spun out of UI-14 on completion, 2026-06-28 — these need backend support or are low-value, unlike the
      E6 part UI-14 did). **E7** schema-drive the `ConfigSection` component roster + `section→component` map, and **E9**
      schema-drive `ConfigWidgets`' per-name/path widget heuristics — **both blocked on backend schema metadata** (a
      per-section `is_component` signal / per-field `widget` hint; the config schema carries neither today), so this is
      a backend+frontend task, not a config-ui-only fix. **E10** i18n the spaCy attribute descriptions
      (`getSpacyAttributeSuggestions`, 21 entries) — config-ui-only but niche (a power-user raw-pattern editor; the
      attribute *keys* stay technical per `donation-choice-surfaces-rule`). _Assessed non-issue (not filed): E8 — the
      `LanguageTabs` display-name map is inherently a UI concern (the backend has no display names) and degrades to
      `code.toUpperCase()`; the `DonationsPage` `['en','ru']` fallback is a defensible default for a rare miss._

### Release Readiness (REL)
- [ ] **REL-1** (P0) — Sign off the Definition-of-release checklist above (fill target + criteria).
- [ ] **REL-2** (P1) — `config-example.toml` + quickstart finalization (the release-time config story).
      _Progress 2026-06-07 (tester-handover prep):_ drafted **`docs/QUICKSTART.md`** (install → config → run CLI/WebAPI/
      config-ui → in/out-of-scope → reporting), and **fixed the `env-example.txt` template** (the quickstart's `.env`
      source crashed a fresh run: it enabled TTS but used the wrong field `AUDIO_OUTPUT`, leaving Audio off → invalid
      config). Recommends the lightweight `minimal`/`api-only` profiles for first run. **Remaining for release:** a curated
      `config-example.toml` (vs the heavy `config-master.toml`), final README pointer, and a friendlier runner message on
      config-validation failure.
- [ ] **REL-3** (P1) — Version bump / changelog / tag.
