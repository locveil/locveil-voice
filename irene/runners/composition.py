"""
Composition root - assembles a fully-wired AsyncVACore from its managers.

ARCH-11 / S3: construction of ALL managers is moved OUT of `AsyncVACore` into
this composition module. The runners are the composition root — the layer
permitted to depend outward on `inputs`/`components`/`workflows` — so the
delivery-layer `InputManager` is imported and built here, then injected into the
core. This is what lets `core` itself stop importing `inputs.manager` (edge 4 of
ARCH-11). (The legacy `AsyncPluginManager` was retired in ARCH-13.)
