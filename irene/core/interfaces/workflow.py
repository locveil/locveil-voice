"""
Workflow Port - The orchestration contract for workflows.

ARCH-11 / S2: the abstraction that `core` (WorkflowManager) depends on, lifted
into the port layer so `core` no longer imports `workflows.base` outward. The
shared pipeline implementation stays in `irene/workflows/base.Workflow`, which
implements this port.

Rooted on `EntryPointMetadata` (decision (c)), matching the live `Workflow`
hierarchy. `RequestContext` is NOT re-exported here — it is a domain type
(`intents/context_models.py`) that `core` imports directly inward.
