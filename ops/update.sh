# Update Irene on the controller (BUILD-10, design D-5). Run after `git pull`:
#   cd /mnt/sdcard/locveil-voice && git pull && ./ops/update.sh
#
# The clone (on the SD card) is the delivery vehicle; the containers mount the
# runtime tree at /mnt/data/locveil-voice-config (same split as the sibling
# locveil-bridge-config). This script bridges the two:
#
# 1. Sync the GIT-OWNED assets content (donations/localization/prompts/templates/web +
#    the donation contract schemas) from the clone into the runtime assets tree.
#    --delete keeps each synced subtree exactly matching the repo; the enumeration is
#    EXPLICIT so runtime-owned subtrees (models/ cache/ state/ traces/ credentials/
#    temp/) are never touched — that's where downloaded models and durable action
#    records live (never delete them on update).
# 2. Pull fresh images and restart; prune old untagged layers (WB flash is small).
