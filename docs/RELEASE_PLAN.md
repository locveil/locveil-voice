# Irene — Release Plan

The single active tracker for the road to release. Supersedes the legacy `docs/TODO.md` +
`docs/TODO/TODO0x` (refactor-era, mostly complete — to be archived under DOC-2).

**Target:** _TBD_ · **Status:** reviving (paused ~Sep 2025, restarted May 2026) · **Version:** 15.0.0

## Definition of release (exit criteria) — _draft, refine_

> **Scope gate (Invariant #6):** release ships only when **every task tagged `[release]` is `[x]`**. Tasks default to
> `[release]` unless explicitly marked `[deferred]` (post-release). Run `scripts/check_scope.py` at each gate to prove
> nothing has drifted (orphan findings, dead links, contradictory status). The exit criteria below are the
> human-readable summary of that gate.

- [ ] Clean `uv sync`; boots in CLI **and** WebAPI modes on x86_64, and as a Docker image.
- [ ] CI green (re-enabled, current action versions).
- [ ] No phantom-reference / runtime `NameError` bugs; pyright (standard) at/under an agreed threshold.
- [ ] Import layering honored: no real cycles, no backwards cross-layer imports per an agreed contract.
- [ ] Test suite runs and passes; coverage understood.
- [ ] Models point to current versions with live download URLs.
- [ ] Docs accurate at the release version; quickstart works end-to-end.
- [ ] **`config-ui` builds (`tsc && vite build`), type-checks clean, and is functional against the release backend.**

---

## Invariants (apply to EVERY task)

1. **Work on `main`; branch only when explicitly asked.**
2. **`configs/config-master.toml` is the canonical config reference** (a release-time `config-example.toml` is a later story).
3. **Architecture target = Hexagonal**; dependencies point inward (domain → application → ports → adapters). Don't add backwards/cross-layer imports (enforced by ARCH-5 import-linter once in place).
4. **`config-ui` must stay functional.** It is a first-class consumer of backend contracts. Any task that changes
   one of these **must update config-ui in the same change and leave it building/type-checking clean**:
   - **Donation schema/format** (`assets/donations/v1.0.json`, `ParameterSpec`/`MethodDonation` shape) → config-ui
     editors (`ParameterSpecEditor`, `Token/SlotPatternsEditor`, `Examples/LemmasEditor`), its **AJV** validation, and `src/types/*`.
   - **Config schema** (`CoreConfig` / `config-master.toml`) → `ConfigSection` editors, `/configuration/config*` calls, `src/types/*`.
   - **REST API endpoints / parameter schemas / analysis endpoints** → `src/utils/apiClient.ts`, the analysis components.
   - Definition-of-done addendum for such tasks: `cd config-ui && npm run type-check && npm run build` passes.
   - Directly-gated tasks: **DOC-5b, DOC-4, DOC-7, QUAL-7, QUAL-10/11, ARCH-1/2/3, BUILD-4.**
5. **Read review docs at START; record outcomes in the ledger + journal at COMPLETION — AFFIRMATIVE &
   NON-NEGOTIABLE until release.** _(Refined 2026-06-02 to a single status home — see Invariant #6.)_
   - **At task START:** read **not only the ledger item but also its related review doc(s)** (per the index below)
     for full context — the ledger item is a spine entry; the review doc holds the evidence, file:line refs, detail.
   - **At task COMPLETION:** flip status in **this ledger** and add a dated entry to **`RELEASE_JOURNAL.md`** —
     **in the same change.** Do **not** re-edit the review doc's status (it is frozen evidence carrying a one-time
     `→ tracked as <ID>` pointer). The **only** reason to edit a review doc is if a *finding itself* is wrong/obsolete
     — then annotate the finding (not a status flip). This kills the dual-status drift while keeping evidence honest.
6. **SINGLE TASK LEDGER (this file is the only source of scope + status).** Every release task has **exactly one ID
   here**; review/design docs may *surface findings* but **a finding is not scope until it has a ledger ID**. No task
   (or its status) lives only in a review doc. Each task is tagged **`[release]`** (must ship) or **`[deferred]`**
   (post-release); **release is blocked until every `[release]` task is `[x]`** (Definition-of-release gate). Run
   `scripts/check_scope.py` at each gate — it flags orphan findings (no ID), dead evidence links, and review-doc
   status markers that contradict the ledger.
7. **ONE JOURNAL.** `RELEASE_JOURNAL.md` is the **only** chronological log. No dated journals / "remediation round" /
   "status update" logs anywhere else (ledger or review docs). Journal entries reference task IDs but never assert
   their status.

## How to use this file

- **Workstreams** are stable buckets. **Tasks** are the unit of work — sized to one coherent commit/PR,
  with a stable ID (referenced in commit messages, e.g. `ARCH-1: …`).
- Status: `- [ ]` open · `- [x]` done · `- [~]` paused/partial · annotate `BLOCKED`/`DEFERRED`/`DOING` + reason inline. Priority `P0–P2`.
- Individual lint findings live in the review docs (e.g. `docs/review/phase0_static_baseline.md`) and
  **roll up** into a task here — keep this file a spine, not a dumping ground.
- **This file = scope + status only.** Record what happened / decisions in **`RELEASE_JOURNAL.md`** (Invariant #7).
  Tag each task **`[release]`** or **`[deferred]`**; the release gate is "every `[release]` task `[x]`" (Invariant #6).

## Sequencing (phased roadmap — decided 2026-06-01)

The review wave (QUAL-8/10/12/14) is done. Its P0s are **not one species**: some are *surgical bug fixes*
(architecture-independent), some are *refactor-flavored* (they ARE subsystem architecture work). They sequence
differently. Key constraint: **there is no test safety net right now** (TEST-2 paused; full rewrite = TEST-7 later),
and the structural refactors **move code** — so blind refactoring/fixing is the main risk. Phases:

- **Gate 0 — verification net + cheap guard (do FIRST, before touching structure):**
  - **TEST-0** — a minimal end-to-end smoke harness (boot + a few real flows: command→intent, set a timer, extract
    a parameter). Small refactor safety net, **distinct from the TEST-7 rewrite**. It's the "wire-up integration
    test" all four reviews said is missing — would have caught every review P0.
  - **QUAL-23** — the startup-assertion ("every configured provider/stage/action name resolves to something real").
    Cheap; catches 3 of 4 review P0 *classes* (cascade names, console provider, dead stages) and stops regressions.
- **Gate 1 — structural foundation:** **ARCH-1** (split god-module) → **ARCH-2** (config↔core cycle) →
  **ARCH-4** (formalize ports) → **ARCH-5** (import-linter; folds in QUAL-23). **DOC-4** in parallel (pin the target).
  **✓ COMPLETE 2026-06-02.**
- **Gate 1.5 — dataflow review + reconciliation. ✓ COMPLETE 2026-06-02.** **QUAL-25** (full input→action flow map +
  defect hunt → `dataflow_review.md`, ~9 P0/~20 P1) → **QUAL-26** (review-of-reviews, live: 10 intended-vs-today
  decisions + finalized Gate 2 framing → `dataflow_reconciliation.md`). Surfaced a 4th cross-cutting theme
  (data-contract integrity) and emitted QUAL-27..31.
- **Gate 2 — the cross-cutting systemic remediation + review P0s (downstream of Gate 1.5; framing per QUAL-26):**
  - **Cross-cutting principles** (the lens; full text in the QUAL section): **① fail-loud** · **② shared bases** ·
    **③ config-truth (deployment-aware)** · **④ data-contract integrity**.
  - **Foundational tasks first:** **QUAL-27** (data-contract fixes; fast, unblocks the command surface) →
    **QUAL-29** (donation format split; precedes declarative device-resolution) + **QUAL-28** (context & action-store
    refactor) as the structural base.
  - **Per-subsystem on top:** **QUAL-9** [FAF], **QUAL-11** [PEX], **QUAL-13** [TXTPROC], **QUAL-15** [LLM],
    **QUAL-16** [PROMPTS], **QUAL-22**, **QUAL-23** + **QUAL-30** (clarification Grade 1).
  - **Later / design-gated:** **QUAL-31** (slot-filling feature) · **ARCH-6** (WS ESP32 input) + **ARCH-7** (output
    seam / MQTT) design sessions · **DOC-7/DOC-8**.

**One-line rule:** *fix the data contracts and the context split first; the per-subsystem P0s ride that foundation.*

## Workstreams

### Architecture & Refactor (ARCH)
Target pattern: **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** — SIGNED OFF 2026-06-01. Code is already ~80% there
(interfaces=ports, providers=adapters, components=app services, entry-points=registry).
See `docs/review/phase1_architecture_map.md` §5.
- [x] **ARCH-0** (P1) — Architecture MAP & document (Goal 1 doc-sync findings + Goal 2 pattern). → `docs/review/phase1_architecture_map.md`
- [x] **ARCH-1** (P0) — Split the `intents/models.py` god-module (in-degree 67). **DONE 2026-06-01** (`cdf8a81`
      audio, `a996dba` context). (1) `AudioData`/`WakeWordResult` → **`irene/utils/audio_data.py`** (zero-dep
      leaf), dropping the `audio_helpers.py` `TYPE_CHECKING` band-aid (real sideways import now). (2)
      `UnifiedConversationContext`/`ConversationState`/`ContextLayer` → **`irene/intents/context_models.py`**, with
      45 importers re-pointed; `Intent`/`IntentResult` stay in `intents/models.py` (thin audio shim retained).
      **Placement deviates from the review sketch (core/) on purpose — NO TYPE_CHECKING:** audio went to `utils`
      (not `core`) to avoid a `utils→core` upward edge; context stayed in the `intents` **domain** package (not
      `core`) because it references `Intent`/`IntentResult` (domain peers) — a real one-directional sideways import
      (`context_models→models`), no cycle, no band-aid. The remaining `core.{entity_resolver,trace_context,
      workflow_manager}→intents.context_models` edges are legitimate **application→domain** (inward) under the
      hexagon, not violations. Verified: no cycle, full suite unchanged (176/55, zero regression), TEST-0 green.
- [x] **ARCH-2** (P0) — Break config↔core / config↔components (SCC-1). **DONE 2026-06-01** (`59f4ae8` + `044ff62`).
      (A) `config/validator.py` discovers providers via `utils.loader.dynamic_loader` (config→utils, downward) —
      no more `from ..core.components import discover_providers` (which `core.components` didn't even export). (B)
      moved the 5 pure schema-extraction methods from `ConfigurationComponent` into `AutoSchemaRegistry` (their
      natural home) — `auto_registry` no longer imports the component; the component delegates downward. (C)
      removed the import-time `validate_schema_integrity()`/`validate_master_config_completeness()` calls from
      `config/__init__.py` (the side effect that amplified SCC-1 and spammed "Schema warning" on every `import
      config`) — now runs once, explicitly, from `ConfigManager.load_config`. (D) **dropped the `core/assets.py`
      `AssetConfig` TYPE_CHECKING band-aid** — `from ..config.models import AssetConfig` is a clean downward
      import now. Verified: no cycle, bare `import config` silent, validation still runs once on load, full suite
      unchanged (176/55, zero regression). **Gate 1: ARCH-3/4/5 next.**
- [x] **ARCH-3** (P1) — Stop components importing delivery/tooling. **DONE 2026-06-01** (`03fc44b`).
      **Edge 1 (code fix):** `asr`/`tts` components imported `web_api.asyncapi` (the `@websocket_api` decorator +
      `extract_websocket_specs_from_router`) — application→delivery. Moved `web_api/asyncapi.py` →
      **`irene/api/asyncapi.py`** (rank-0; its only irene deps were `__version__` + `api.schemas`, and its fastapi
      import was docstring-only), re-pointed all importers. **Components now import no `web_api` module** — the
      AsyncAPI mechanism is a neutral rank-0 port both sides depend on downward. **Edge 2 (classification, no code):**
      `components.nlu_analysis→analysis.*` — verified `analysis` is a **clean, self-contained driven adapter** (no
      inward imports into components/workflows/web_api), and `NLUAnalysisComponent` is its dedicated wrapper (the
      adapter boundary). Per the review's "treat analysis as a driven adapter", this is a legitimate
      application→driven-adapter relationship; a port for one-consumer tooling would be over-engineering. **ARCH-5
      import-linter rule:** forbid `components → web_api`/`analysis` generally, but **allow `nlu_analysis → analysis`**
      as the adapter boundary. Verified: full suite unchanged (176/55, zero regression), TEST-0 green.
- [x] **ARCH-4** (P2) — Formalize ports. **DONE 2026-06-02** (`df93a15`). Found a healthy **two-layer** port
      structure: component-capability ports (`core/interfaces/*Plugin`, implemented by components) + adapter ports
      (`providers/*/base.py *Provider`, inherited by adapters). **Audit:** adapter ports exist for all 7 categories
      and **no adapter imports a sibling concrete adapter** (adapters depend only on their abstraction ✓).
      **Gap-filled** (the 3 categories with no capability port): added `core/interfaces/{nlu,text_processing,
      voice_trigger}.py` (`NLUPlugin`/`TextProcessorPlugin`/`VoiceTriggerPlugin`, one `@abstractmethod` each typed
      with real domain types — **no TYPE_CHECKING**, cycle-verified) and made the 3 components inherit their port.
      (Chosen scope: capability-port gap-fill; the `*Provider` adapter ports stay in `providers/` — already clean.
      The bigger "unify the two hierarchies" move was considered and deferred as over-engineering for P2.) Verified:
      all 3 components instantiate + `isinstance` their port, no cycle, functional suite unchanged. **Gate 1: ARCH-5
      (import-linter) is the capstone next.**
- [x] **ARCH-5** (P1) — Add an **import-linter** contract so the hexagon is enforced and can't regress.
      **DONE 2026-06-02** (`27a85c3`). Added `import-linter` (dev dep) + `[tool.importlinter]` contracts in
      pyproject + `irene/tests/test_import_contracts.py` (runs them in the suite — enforced now; ready for CI when
      BUILD-2 lands). **6 contracts, 0 broken:** domain depends on nothing outward (ARCH-1); config no upward
      (ARCH-2); components no delivery + only `nlu_analysis→analysis` (ARCH-3); adapters no application + provider
      categories independent (ARCH-4). Residual fix (no TYPE_CHECKING): moved `RequestContext` (last
      domain→workflows edge) into `intents/context_models.py`. The linter **caught a real anti-pattern → QUAL-24**
      (8 handlers use `get_core()` service-locator; ignored in the domain contract with a comment, tracked
      separately). _The deliverable that makes "follows the architecture" verifiable._ **Gate 1 COMPLETE
      (ARCH-1..5 ✓).** _Note (2026-06-02): the `core→inputs/workflows/components.base` edges were left unenforced here
      as "composition-root behavior" — that reclassification is **REVOKED → ARCH-11** (fix via DI + add the contract)._
- [ ] **ARCH-6** [WS] (P1) — **REFRAMED by QUAL-26 (Q4): WebSocket streaming-input driving adapter — the primary
      ESP32 transport.** The dead `InputManager._input_queue` + base64 `AUDIO_DATA:` path (P0-8) is a broken
      placeholder to be **replaced by a proper WS streaming adapter**, not patched. Design (needs a **design session**):
      wake word runs **on-device (ESP32)** → device streams audio over WS (`skip_wake_word=True` server-side) → server
      ASR → pipeline; the WS connection also runs the **`ClientRegistry` registration handshake** (room +
      `available_devices`) — the linchpin that populates the Q6/QUAL-28 physical-identity store (resolves P1-j at its
      root). Also fix the contained `inputs.base ⇄ subclasses` cycle (SCC-2). Server-side voice-trigger (+ the
      `WakeWordResult` bug) is only for non-ESP32 local-mic. Intertwined with **ARCH-7** (the return channel: WS audio
      response to the ESP32 + MQTT smart-home actuation). → `docs/design/ws_esp32_transport.md`.
- [ ] **ARCH-7** [MQTT] (P-TBD) — **Design session** (needs live collaboration): place MQTT publication as a driven
      **output adapter** in the hexagon (intent result/action → output port → MQTT adapter). Defines the general
      output-port seam — MQTT is the **first non-audio output** (today output is TTS/audio-only via
      `_handle_tts_output`; there is no `irene/outputs/` package). Evaluate placement (output adapter vs
      fire-and-forget action type [FAF] vs MQTT intent handlers per `docs/intent_mqtt.md`); integrate
      `ClientRegistry`/`DeviceEntityResolver` for room/device topics; define topic schema (HA convention?) + config
      model; reconcile/supersede `docs/intent_mqtt.md`. → `docs/design/mqtt_integration.md`.
- [ ] **ARCH-8** [MQTT] (P-TBD) — Implement per ARCH-7 (output-port seam + MQTT adapter + config + handler/action
      integration + tests). Split into PR-sized tasks from the design.
- [ ] **ARCH-9** [INFER] (P-TBD) — **Design session** (needs live collaboration): a **shared sherpa-onnx (k2-fsa)
      inference layer** behind the existing ASR/TTS/VoiceTrigger ports. Today inference is **provider-owned and
      fragmented** — whisper→torch, silero v3/v4→torch, vosk→Kaldi C++, openWakeWord & vosk-tts→onnxruntime
      (black-boxed); 2–3 runtimes loaded in one process, no shared session/asset management. Key enabler:
      **`onnxruntime 1.22.1` is already a transitive dep** (via `openwakeword` + `vosk-tts`); zero direct use in
      `irene/`. sherpa-onnx is one ONNX runtime spanning **ASR** (EN+RU Zipformer, streaming+offline), **TTS**
      (100+ VITS/40+ langs incl. RU), **wake-word/KWS**, and **VAD** — int8 and edge-sized (RU small 45MB→21MB,
      full 1.9GB→929MB, WER 6.1), serving the offline + **[ESP32]** goals. **Constraint (user, do not violate):
      NOT a rip-and-replace.** Whisper and Silero stay **first-class** — both are genuinely strong and target
      **different deployment profiles** (they'd never co-exist in one real deployment); sherpa-onnx is an
      **additional backend family**, not a replacement. **Also explore sherpa-onnx variants of those models**
      (Whisper exported to ONNX runs under sherpa-onnx; Silero-VAD is ONNX) so the *same* models can optionally
      run on the unified runtime — dropping torch from edge images while keeping the models. Hexagonal placement:
      adapters stay behind their ports; "**sherpa runtime + model-asset loader**" becomes a shared driven-adapter/
      infra service (extends `core/assets.py`). Explicitly **avoid** a generic torch+onnx+Kaldi abstraction
      (leaky, low value) — the real shared seam is the ONNX runtime itself. Decisions for the session: modality
      order (ASR-RU spike first); **RU TTS quality A/B** (sherpa VITS/Piper vs Silero v4 — the one non-obvious
      win); **wake-word consolidation** (sherpa KWS vs openWakeWord/microWakeWord — intersects **QUAL-19/20
      [ESP32]**); config model + Invariant #4; dependency/image + armv7 impact of the sherpa-onnx wheel.
      Intersects ASR/TTS providers, ASSET (model zoo/format), ARCH-4 (ports). → `docs/design/onnx_inference_layer.md`.
- [ ] **ARCH-10** [INFER] (P-TBD) — Implement per ARCH-9. First spike: a **sherpa-onnx ASR provider** (RU Zipformer
      int8) on a shared runtime+asset helper, alongside vosk/whisper; then expand per the design (TTS family,
      wake-word) keeping whisper/silero as first-class options. Gated by Invariant #4 (provider config →
      config-ui). Split into PR-sized tasks from the design.
- [ ] **ARCH-11** `[release]` (P1) — **Fix the `core → inputs/workflows/components.base` composition-root edges
      properly — REVOKES the ARCH-5 reclassification** (which deemed them "legitimate composition-root behavior" and
      left them unenforced; user reverses that 2026-06-02). Edges: `core.{engine,workflow_manager}→inputs.base`,
      `core.workflow_manager→workflows.base`, `core.components→components.base`. **Fix = invert via DI/ports:** the
      composition root (runners) injects concrete inputs/workflows/components into the core managers through
      `core/interfaces` ports, so `core` depends on abstractions, not concrete delivery/application modules. Then add
      **import-linter contract(s)** forbidding `core → inputs`/`workflows`/`components.base` (remove any exemption),
      satisfying the Definition-of-release "no backwards cross-layer imports" criterion. **Slot/sequencing: lands
      AFTER ARCH-6** (inputs become a proper WS driving adapter — the input-side DI seam) **and QUAL-28** (the
      `workflow_manager`/context refactor reshapes the `core→workflows` edge); ARCH-11 is the final hexagon-tightening
      that makes those two coherent and enforced. Refs: `phase1_architecture_map.md` §2.3 (core-orchestrating-outward
      row, "legitimize via DI"), §5 step 6.
- [ ] **ARCH-12** `[deferred]` (P2) — **Residual upward edges** (benign, no functional impact; not import-linter
      violations today). `utils.vad → core.metrics` (metrics should be a port injected into utils, or vad shouldn't
      emit metrics directly) and `utils.logging → config.models` (a `LogLevel` enum reach-up). Captured to close the
      single-ledger gap (Invariant #6) — these were the only findings living solely in a review doc
      (`phase1_architecture_map.md` §2.3). Deferred: do post-Gate-2 (or alongside ARCH-11) if cheap.

### Code Quality & Review (QUAL)
- [x] **QUAL-1** — Phase-0 static baseline (ruff/pyright/vulture/validators/import-graph). → `docs/review/phase0_static_baseline.md` (6e39886)
- [x] **QUAL-2** — Review round 1: phantom-reference `NameError`s + method shadowing. → b6cd282
- [ ] **QUAL-3** (P1) — Category D wiring: `Monitoring`/`Configuration` define `get_python_dependencies` as an
      unbound instance method; the 4 runners miss the metadata methods. Done when: `dependency_validator --validate-all` passes 58/58.
- [ ] **QUAL-4** (P1) — Type-safety debt: re-tighten `mypy.ini`/`pyrightconfig.json` and burn down the ~1063
      standard-mode pyright errors (subdivide after ARCH lands). Refs: §E.
- [ ] **QUAL-5** (P2) — Cruft: 360 unused imports, 62 star-imports, vulture dead-code pool. Refs: §G.
- [ ] **QUAL-6** (P2) — Config schema gap: 9 `CoreConfig` fields without section models (import-time warning). Refs: §H.
- [ ] **QUAL-7** (P2) — `configs/config-master.toml` puts train-schedule under `[intent_system.handlers.train_schedule]`,
      but the model field is `IntentSystemConfig.train_schedule` (→ `[intent_system.train_schedule]`). The
      config-master section is orphaned/ignored. Reconcile config-master with the model. (Found during DOC-5.)
- [x] **QUAL-8** [FAF] (P1) — Fire-and-forget full review & gap analysis. **DONE 2026-06-01** →
      `docs/review/fire_and_forget_review.md` (5×P0, 8×P1, 6×P2). Verdict: **F&F is broken end-to-end** and the
      legacy `docs/fire_forget_issues.md` "✅ COMPLETED" is **materially false** (banner added). Legacy issues:
      #4 FIXED, #6 FIXED-but-moot, #1 & #5 CHANGED-still-broken, #2 CHANGED-unreachable, #3 CONFIRMED. Plan
      correction: ~13 call sites in 3 handlers, not "~83".
- [ ] **QUAL-9** [FAF] (P1) — Remediate F&F (ranked in the review). **P0s:** (1) **timers crash on launch** —
      duplicate `session_id` kwarg in `execute_fire_and_forget_with_context` (`base.py:125`+kwargs vs
      `timer.py:228`) → `TypeError`, only `ValueError` caught → timer creation fails outright; (2) **domain vs
      action_name key mismatch** — launch stores `active_actions[action_name]` (`base.py:500`), removal keys by
      `domain` (`base.py:636`) → `remove_completed_action` always misses → leak + dead completion/metrics/
      notifications; fix by keying everything on the unique `action_name` (also fixes same-domain clobber); (3)
      **`get_or_create_context` doesn't exist** (only `get_context`) — called in `base.py:633`/`notifications.py:174,229`/
      `debug_tools.py:101` → swallowed `AttributeError`; (4) **action tasks orphaned** (GC-cancellable) — hold strong
      refs; (5) **`active_actions` unbounded** — bound + prune (MemoryManager skips it). **P1s:** timeout monitor
      `wait_for` not flat-sleep; capture-before-pop; collapse the two write-back processors; per-action metrics keying;
      finish timer-cancellation cleanup (`timer.py:631`). Then **TEST-3** lifecycle coverage. Gated by Invariant #4.
- [x] **QUAL-10** [PEX] (P1) — Text→parameters (parameter extraction) full review. **DONE 2026-06-01** →
      `docs/review/parameter_extraction_review.md` (6×P0, 11×P1, 12×P2). Verdict: donation-driven extraction is
      largely **aspirational** — in practice it's spaCy NER + per-param regex + heuristics with **no contract
      enforcement**; the richest author-facing mechanisms (`slot_patterns`/`token_patterns`/`ParameterSpec.
      extraction_patterns`) are validated-then-discarded **dead code**; the two NLU providers extract with divergent
      contracts; failures are swallowed silently; resolvers *fatally crash* on asset-loader timing while the rest
      *silently no-ops*.
- [ ] **QUAL-11** [PEX] (P1) — Remediate parameter-extraction gaps (ranked in the review). **P0s:** (1) fix the
      default `provider_cascade_order` — it names non-existent providers (`keyword_matcher`/`spacy_rules_sm`/
      `spacy_semantic_md` vs real `hybrid_keyword_matcher`/`spacy_nlu`, `nlu_component.py:380`) + add a startup
      assertion; (2) decide the slot/extraction-pattern story (implement, or remove the dead author-visible fields);
      (3) make required-param a real contract on a **shared** extraction base (raise on missing-required, stop
      swallowing, always apply `default_value`, unify spaCy+hybrid → deterministic param surface); (4) de-fatalize
      the entity resolvers (degrade, don't crash the request, when the asset loader isn't wired); (5) **QUAL-22**
      (finish/delete the context-enhancement stub). **P1s:** typed `ParameterSpec`-driven entity accessor on
      `IntentHandler`; fix first-match span→value; default `_md` spaCy models for similarity; unify duplicate device
      resolution. Gated by Invariant #4 (config-ui). **Concrete failing case (found by TEST-0):** `поставь таймер
      на 5 минут` is not recognized (→ `conversation.general`) despite the timer donation being loaded — fix +
      verify via TEST-0's `test_set_timer_end_to_end` (currently xfail).
- [x] **QUAL-12** [TXTPROC] (P2) — Text-processor subsystem review. **DONE 2026-06-01** →
      `docs/review/text_processing_review.md` (5×P0, 6×P1, 6×P2). Verdict: the subsystem is **mostly decorative at
      runtime** — `process()` is hardcoded to stage `"general"`, so only `general_text_processor` ever runs (on ASR
      output); the `asr_output`/`tts_input` stages are never routed; **TTS synthesizes raw text** (no normalization
      call site); the `[text_processor.normalizers.*]` config tree is **dead** (never read); the WebAPI 500s on a
      phantom `self.processor`; `number_text_processor` duplicates `asr_text_processor` and is unreachable;
      `NumberTextProcessor.process()` calls a non-existent method. **LLM-for-text-processing answer:** architecturally
      possible (open provider interface + DI), not wired today (only the dead `universal_llm` path), and should only
      be an **opt-in online-only `asr_output` stage** augmenting the deterministic default — never on the default path.
- [ ] **QUAL-13** [TXTPROC] (P1) — Refine per QUAL-12: **collapse + wire.** (1) Collapse the 4 providers into ONE
      config-driven `TextProcessor` with ordered **per-stage normalizer chains** (make the config tree real, delete
      the provider-per-stage classes + redundant `number` provider); (2) **actually wire the two real stages** —
      `process()` must pass the caller's stage (`asr_output` at `voice_assistant.py:383`) and **add the missing
      `tts_input` call before TTS synthesis** (`:707`) so Russian TTS normalization (RUNorm) actually runs; (3)
      delete the dead (`self.processor` WebAPI bug, `NumberTextProcessor.process()`, `_stage_providers`, the
      `number_options` keys that map to nothing); (4) document real deps (RUNorm runtime model download, lingua-franca
      ru-only fallback); (5) optionally add a disabled-by-default online `llm_text_processor` (asr_output). Gated by
      Invariant #4 (config-ui). Intersects ASSET-3, QUAL-15.
- [x] **QUAL-14** [LLM] (P1) — LLM usage + offline-first review. **DONE 2026-06-01** →
      `docs/review/llm_usage_review.md` (3×P0, 9×P1, 12×P2). **NLU confirmed LLM-free**; offline-first is real for
      recognized intents but the **LLM stage's offline fallback is a phantom** — the configured `console` LLM
      provider **does not exist** (no class/entry-point), `fallback_providers` is never used at runtime, and
      `generate_response` hard-fails offline. The pipeline survives offline only because the conversation handler
      independently `is_available()`-gates to templates. **NLU-LLM recommendation: keep NLU deterministic +
      offline-first; any LLM assist must be opt-in and LOCAL (not cloud) — gated on a real local LLM, which ties to
      ARCH-9/10 [INFER]. Fix the offline foundation + QUAL-11 extraction first.** Prompt inventory captured for QUAL-16.
- [ ] **QUAL-15** [LLM] (P1) — Act on QUAL-14. **P0s:** (1) implement a real local LLM fallback (console/echo at
      minimum, ideally a local-model provider) + register its entry-point, OR drop `console` from configs and
      document LLM as online-only; add a startup assertion that every `default_provider`/`fallback_providers`
      resolves to a discovered provider; (2) make `fallback_providers` actually iterate at runtime (mirror
      TTS/audio, not `keys()[0]`); (3) give `generate_response` a graceful offline outcome (don't raise). **P1s:**
      `openai.is_available()` local check; per-call timeouts + client reuse; fix the dead ASR `universal_llm`
      lookup; stop `enhance_text` masking failures as success; `silero_v3.is_available()` local check. NLU-LLM
      assist (local, opt-in) deferred behind ARCH-9/10 + QUAL-11.
- [ ] **QUAL-16** [PROMPTS] (P1) — Prompt hardening for ALL LLM use cases: audit every prompt — asset YAML
      (`assets/prompts/<handler>/<lang>.yaml`) **and inline-in-code prompts** (translation/text_enhancement/
      conversation handlers) — and rewrite for clarity, guardrails, output-format constraints, persona
      consistency, and prompt-injection resistance. Establish a prompt-authoring convention. Gated by Invariant #4
      (config-ui `PromptEditor`). Done when: prompts hardened + `docs/guides/PROMPTING_GUIDE.md` exists.
- [ ] **QUAL-17** [STREAMAPI] (P2, must-before-release) — Critically review the streaming-API exposure: the
      hand-rolled **AsyncAPI 2.6.0** generator (`irene/web_api/asyncapi.py`: `@websocket_api` decorators,
      `WebSocketRegistry`, custom Pydantic→AsyncAPI conversion) + the `@asyncapi/web-component@2.6.4` renderer at
      `/asyncapi`, documenting the WebSocket endpoints (`/asr/stream`, `/asr/binary`, `/ws`). Evaluate modern
      alternatives (AsyncAPI 3.0, maintained generator libraries, current renderers/Studio) — simpler/more
      maintainable today? Done when: `docs/review/streaming_api_review.md` exists with a keep/upgrade/replace recommendation.
- [ ] **QUAL-18** [STREAMAPI] (P-TBD) — Act on QUAL-17 (upgrade/replace the AsyncAPI generator + renderer).
- [ ] **QUAL-19** [ESP32] (P2, last pre-release) — Full review & questioning of the ESP32 + wakeword story:
      ESP32 firmware subsystem (ESP-IDF nodes/common/tools, embedded microWakeWord model **not committed**,
      binary-WS audio streaming) — functional vs aspirational; the backend **microWakeWord provider is largely a
      placeholder** (stub feature extraction; depends on trained models but training was removed at `886d4d1`;
      HF model download = **TODO11, still Open**); openWakeWord (works) vs microWakeWord (broken/redundant?);
      residual training dead-code; armv7/embedded build viability (`Dockerfile.armv7`, `embedded-armv7`); ESP32
      docs accuracy. Intersects ASSET-2 (wakeword model URLs). Done when: `docs/review/esp32_wakeword_review.md`
      exists with a **keep/fix/cut** recommendation per piece {ESP32 firmware, microWakeWord, armv7, training refs}.
- [ ] **QUAL-20** [ESP32] (P-TBD) — Act on QUAL-19 (complete TODO11 + real feature extraction, OR cut/archive
      microWakeWord + ESP32 + residual training refs; reconcile armv7; close TODO11 accordingly).
- [ ] **QUAL-21** (P1) — **Prod bug found via TEST-2**: `ComponentConfig` field drift not propagated to all callers.
      The component fields are now `{asr, audio, tts, nlu, text_processor, llm, voice_trigger, intent_system,
      monitoring, nlu_analysis, configuration}` — there is **no** `audio_output`, `microphone`, or `web_api`
      (mic/web moved to `config.inputs.*` / `config.system.web_api_enabled`; `audio_output`→`audio`). But
      `irene/runners/settings_runner.py` (the `irene-settings` Gradio runner) still does
      `config.components.audio_output` (L279) and `ComponentConfig(audio_output=…, microphone=…, web_api=…)` (L305)
      → **would crash on launch**. `irene/examples/{dependency_demo,component_demo,config_demo}.py` have the same
      stale kwargs. Fix the runner against the real model (and inputs/system split); update/retire the examples.
      Not done in the TEST pass because the mic/web migration is non-trivial (needs the inputs/system split, not a
      rename). Verify `irene-settings` boots after.

- [ ] **QUAL-22** [PEX] (P2) — **Stubbed feature found via TEST-2, confirmed by QUAL-10**: context-aware NLU
      enhancement is a no-op. `ContextAwareNLUProcessor._disambiguate_with_device_context` (`nlu_component.py`
      157-187 — the method QUAL-22 first called `_enhance_intent`) computes `enhanced_entities`
      (`output_capabilities`, `context_suggestion`, `preferred_output_device`) but then **returns the original
      intent unchanged** (comment: "for now, return original"); location inference (`location_resolved`) is
      unimplemented. Either finish the enhancement (apply enhanced_entities / wire capability + location context)
      or remove the dead logic. Relates to QUAL-10 [PEX]. xfail tests: `test_client_capability_context`,
      `test_room_context_inference`.
- [x] **QUAL-23** (P1, Gate 0) — **Startup name-resolution assertion.** **DONE 2026-06-01** →
      `irene/core/startup_validation.py` (+ wired in `core/components.py` after coordination; unit tests in
      `irene/tests/test_startup_validation.py`, 4✓). Checks every configured `default_provider`/`fallback_providers`/
      `provider_cascade_order` and every enabled `[<component>.providers.<name>]` resolves to a **registered
      entry-point** (names enumerated, not loaded — optional-dep import failures don't false-positive). Non-fatal by
      default (logs a clear ERROR per unresolved name so a shipped config still boots); `IRENE_STARTUP_STRICT=1`
      raises (CI / TEST-0). Verified on config-master: flags exactly the phantom **`console` LLM** (fallback +
      enabled block — the QUAL-15 bug), zero false positives (TTS/audio `console` are real → pass; NLU cascade
      clean). Folds into ARCH-5 (CI). Note: text-processor **stage-routing** completeness (dead `command_input`
      stage) is provider-name-orthogonal → stays under QUAL-13.
- [ ] **QUAL-24** (P2) — **Service-locator → DI in handlers (found by ARCH-5).** 8 intent handlers
      (`speech_recognition`, `audio_playback`, `voice_synthesis`, `system`, `conversation`, `provider_control`,
      `text_enhancement`, `translation`) fetch components via `from ...core.engine import get_core` →
      `core.component_manager.get_component(...)` — a service-locator that makes the **domain reach into the
      composition root** (transitively pulling components/inputs/workflows). Convert to **dependency injection**
      (inject the needed components via the existing handler-DI path, like the monitoring component injection),
      then **remove the `ignore_imports` exception** from the ARCH-5 domain contract so it enforces with no
      escape hatch. Domain-cleanliness; relates to ARCH-1.
- [x] **QUAL-25** [DFLOW] (P1) — **End-to-end dataflow & context-models review.** **DONE 2026-06-02** →
      `docs/review/dataflow_review.md` (~9 P0, ~20 P1, long P2 tail; 5 parallel tracers → synthesis →
      adversarial-verify on the headline NEW P0s). **Headline NEW finding: a field rename `Intent.text`→`raw_text`
      was never propagated** — `intent.text` is read at 14 unguarded sites across 7 handlers + `Intent(text=…)` at
      `orchestrator.py:217`, so TTS-speak/translation/text-enhance/provider-switch/ASR-audio-provider/contextual
      commands all `AttributeError`, masked by the orchestrator as a generic error (verified vs source). Other NEW
      P0s: `session_id="default"` collapses all sessions (cross-request/room/user leak); `MemoryManager` cleanup loop
      dead (calls non-existent methods); `InputManager._input_queue`/WebSocket `AUDIO_DATA:` input path dead
      (captured mic/web audio dropped — overlaps ARCH-6); required-params never enforced. **CONFIRMS** the FAF P0s
      (timer crash, key-mismatch completion death, `get_or_create_context`) and TXTPROC (TTS gets raw text). Found a
      **4th cross-cutting theme — "data-contract drift"** (model contracts silently disagree across boundaries:
      `Intent.text`/`raw_text`, `WakeWordResult.word`/`wake_word`, action key `action_name`/`domain`, session scope)
      — these are refactor residue the relaxed pyright (Phase-0 §E) was configured not to see. §2 resolves the DOC-8
      request-vs-session question (→ DOC-8 write-up). §4+§6 are the **QUAL-26** agenda. **Spawns:** QUAL-26
      (reconcile) + new P0s for the Gate 2 backlog (numbered in QUAL-26) + DOC-8.
- [x] **QUAL-26** [DFLOW] (P1) — **Review-of-reviews: reconcile inconsistencies, decide intended-vs-actual.**
      **DONE 2026-06-02** → `docs/review/dataflow_reconciliation.md` (live Q&A, 10 issues decided, committed
      per-decision). Consolidated all review docs + the QUAL-25 dataflow findings and decided **intended-vs-today** for
      each. Headline decisions: **Model 2 — split identity from session** (physical-identity store holds `active_actions`
      + devices, long-lived; conversation session holds history, short-lived idle-window); **dedicated zombie-resistant
      action store** (`action_name`-keyed); **`raw_text` = original utterance** (P0-1 fix); **declarative device/room
      via a donation format split** (language-neutral contract + per-language phrasing; `entity_type` + `room_context`
      tri-state); **fail-loud → conversational clarification** (configurable LLM/deterministic); **WebSocket = primary
      ESP32 transport** (reframes ARCH-6). Surfaced a **4th cross-cutting theme: data-contract integrity.** Finalized
      Gate 2 framing (hybrid: principles block + discrete tasks) and emitted **QUAL-27…31** (below). See the doc for
      the full per-issue rationale.

#### Cross-cutting systemic remediation — principles (the Gate 2 lens)
_Apply to every remediation task below (from the 4 review docs + QUAL-25/26). Source: `dataflow_reconciliation.md`._
- **① Fail-loud** — raise structured exceptions → catch at ONE handler/orchestrator boundary → typed
  `IntentResult(success=False, error=…)`; **never swallow, guess a default, or return-original-on-failure.** The
  user-facing form is a **conversational clarification** (explain + ask), not an error dump; missing-required and
  no-intent both clarify. Backed by a **donation-driven typed accessor** (one place enforces required-vs-optional).
- **② Shared bases** — one NLU extraction base (donation-`ParameterSpec`-driven), one LLM prompt source (= the
  LLM-independent hardening layer), one normalization seam (contains the `lingua_franca`/`Runorm` debt), one F&F
  write-back, one result-construction contract. No copy-paste-then-diverge.
- **③ Config-truth (deployment-aware)** — every key is schema-known with **no dead trees** (consumed by *some*
  codepath in *some* profile) **and** every *enabled* component/provider/stage resolves to real code. `config-master`
  is a valid curated **superset**; deployment configs are minimal subsets — the check must not flag the superset.
- **④ Data-contract integrity** — a model field means **one thing end-to-end**; no rename residue
  (`Intent.text`/`raw_text`, `WakeWordResult.word`/`wake_word`, action key `action_name`/`domain`, session scope).
- [ ] **QUAL-27** [DFLOW] (P0) — **Data-contract fixes (theme ④; fast, unblocks the command surface).**
      `Intent.text`→`raw_text` at all 14 handler sites + `orchestrator.py:217` (P0-1, the biggest single defect;
      `raw_text` = **original utterance**, NLU stops overwriting it — Q1); `WakeWordResult.word` consumer rename
      (P1-b); **delete `Intent.session_id`** (use `context.session_id`); enforce the `IntentResult` error contract
      (`success=False` ⟹ non-empty `error`, P1-a) + unify the forked `_create_error_result` (P1-t). Refs:
      `dataflow_reconciliation.md` Q1/Q7.
- [ ] **QUAL-28** [DFLOW] (P0) — **Context & session refactor (Q2/Q3; foundational).** Split
      `UnifiedConversationContext` → a **long-lived physical-identity store** (room/device/client; holds
      `active_actions` + device capabilities; `ClientRegistry` = device source-of-truth) + a **short-lived conversation
      session** (history + `ConversationState`). **Dedicated zombie-resistant action store**, `action_name`-keyed
      (`domain` = router index), 4-layer reaping (completion callback · read-time liveness filter · periodic sweep ·
      TTL+cap). **Session lifecycle:** idle-window (T=10m / voice ~5m, configurable) + sliding history window (N=15,
      wire `max_history_turns`); per-modality boundaries (voice=wake-word burst, WS=connection, REST=conversation-id).
      Forbid the literal `"default"` (P0-6); split `get`/`get_or_create`; **kill `extract_room_from_session`** (P1-o);
      unify eviction on `last_activity`. Delete `MemoryManager` (P0-7) + `ContextLayer`/progressive-context (Q4). Refs:
      Q2/Q3/Q4.
- [ ] **QUAL-29** [DFLOW] (P1) — **Donation format split (Q6; precedes declarative device-resolution).** Split
      donations into a **language-neutral contract** (method list + invariant `ParameterSpec` core: name/type/required/
      choices/min-max + **`entity_type`** {device/location/room/person/generic} + per-method **`room_context`**
      {required/none/conditional}) + **per-language files** (phrases/lemmas/token/slot patterns + language-specific
      `extraction_patterns`/`aliases`). Schema `v1.0`→`v1.1`; update the loader (`core/donations.py`,
      `core/intent_asset_loader.py`); shrink `cross_language_validator` to phrasing-completeness. Delete the heuristic
      `_is_device_entity`/`_is_location_entity` + hardcoded device-domain set. Intersects DOC-5b, DOC-7, UI-1/2/3.
- [ ] **QUAL-30** [DFLOW] (P1) — **Clarification UX — Grade 1 (theme ①; with the typed accessor).** At the fail-loud
      boundary, convert structured failures (missing-required, unresolved device/room per `room_context`,
      no-intent-identified) into a single-turn **explain-and-ask** response. **Configurable responder:** LLM if present
      (natural), else **deterministic + localized** (from `ParameterSpec.description` + per-language prompt; offline
      guarantee). Fix the fake `confidence=1.0` NLU fallback. Refs: Q7.
- [ ] **QUAL-31** [DFLOW] (P2, feature) — **Clarification UX — Grade 2 (multi-turn slot-filling).** `pending_clarification`
      on the conversation session + `ConversationState = awaiting-clarification` + a pipeline pre-check that fills the
      slot from the next turn and completes the original intent (symmetric to the F&F `contextual` check, but transient).
      Expires with the Q2 idle window. Follow-up to QUAL-30.

### Tests (TEST)
> **Strategy (decided 2026-06-01): do NOT keep repairing the existing suite.** Most tests were written against
> pre-refactor code and will be invalidated by the ARCH refactors (ARCH-1..5) and the code reviews (QUAL-8/10/12/14).
> Fixing them now is throwaway work. The TEST-1/TEST-2 pass already extracted the real value — it **proved the suite
> runs** and surfaced concrete prod findings (QUAL-21, QUAL-22, the text_processor trace fix). The current state
> (166 pass / 56 fail / 13 skip / 2 xfail, all committed) stands as a **partial safety net**; the remaining 56
> failures are left **intentionally unfixed**. The real test effort is **TEST-7: rewrite the suite after the
> architecture + code reviews land** (gated). TEST-3/4/5/6 are coverage goals folded into that rewrite.
- [x] **TEST-0** (P0) — Minimal end-to-end smoke/integration harness (refactor safety net, Gate 0). **DONE
      2026-06-01** → `irene/tests/test_smoke_e2e.py` (**5 passed / 1 xfailed**, ~21s; boots the WebAPI runner once
      as a subprocess + a CLI headless check). Green flows: WebAPI boots, `привет`→`greeting.hello`, `/nlu/recognize`
      responds, LLM-offline conversation degrades gracefully (200, no crash — guards QUAL-14/15), CLI headless
      executes. **xfail:** `test_set_timer_end_to_end` — documents the timer breakage (QUAL-9 + QUAL-11), auto-flips
      when fixed. **New finding via TEST-0:** `поставь таймер на 5 минут` is **not recognized** (falls to
      `conversation.general`) *despite the timer donation being loaded* — a recognition/matching gap → logged under
      QUAL-11. So timers are **doubly broken** (recognition AND the F&F launch crash). Still TODO: wire into CI (BUILD-2).
- [x] **TEST-1** (P1) — Fix broken tests referencing removed/renamed symbols. **DONE 2026-06-01**:
      `ConversationContext`→`UnifiedConversationContext` (rename); `TTLCache`/`ContextualCommandPerformanceManager`/
      `initialize_performance_manager` were **deleted** (v13→v15 contextual-command unification) → those tests
      skipped-with-reason; `Intent.text`→`raw_text`, `ComponentConfig.audio_output`→`audio` renamed in tests.
- [~] **TEST-2** (P1) — **PAUSED 2026-06-01 (deliberate — see strategy note).** Suite now **runs** and is a
      partial safety net: 136/100/0 → **166 passed / 56 failed / 13 skipped / 2 xfailed** (committed). Cleared:
      async config, symbol renames, obsolete skips, hardcoded-path bug, and the fixture-wiring cluster. The
      remaining 56 drift failures are **left unfixed on purpose** (will be obsoleted by ARCH/review then rewritten,
      TEST-7). Diagnosed-but-not-fixed clusters (for whoever does the rewrite): `test_cascading_nlu`
      provider-metadata (`entities["provider"]` vs `_recognition_provider`, ~7 — design-intent question),
      VAD/ASR metrics dict-vs-object (~8), `spacy_asset_integration` mock-vs-MagicMock (2), attr renames
      (`IntentResult.error_type`, `SpaCyNLUProvider.model_name`, `IntentRegistry._handlers`,
      `IntentComponent.get_system_status`), phase4 contextual-command + assertions. Value already banked:
      **QUAL-21**, **QUAL-22**, text_processor trace fix.
- [ ] **TEST-7** (P1) — **Rewrite the test suite against the stabilized architecture.** GATED by: ARCH-1..5
      (structure settled + import-linter) **and** the code reviews (QUAL-8/10/12/14) landing. Replace the
      pre-refactor suite (which the TEST-1/2 pass kept *running* but not green) with tests written to the hexagon:
      ports/adapters seams, the unified workflow, and real fixtures (e.g. the localization-asset loader pattern
      from `test_context_aware_nlu`). Absorbs the coverage goals below (TEST-3/4/5/6) and decides, per failing
      cluster left by TEST-2, rewrite-vs-delete. Done when: suite is green (or green-modulo-documented-xfail) and
      coverage is understood/trusted.
- [ ] **TEST-6** (P2) — _(folded into TEST-7)_ Restore ASR provider-fallback + resampling coverage (the 7 phase7
      tests skipped in TEST-1 called the removed `_handle_sample_rate_mismatch`; feature lives in
      `AudioProcessor.resample_audio_data`).
- [ ] **TEST-3** [FAF] (P2) — _(coverage goal for TEST-7)_ Fire-and-forget lifecycle coverage (launch → completion
      → error → cleanup → context propagation). Scope after QUAL-8.
- [ ] **TEST-4** [PEX] (P1) — _(coverage goal for TEST-7)_ Parameter-extraction coverage (user-flagged as key):
      the 8 ParameterTypes, the 4 entity resolvers, pattern matching; rebuild around `test_parameter_schema_unification`/
      `test_context_aware_nlu`/`test_cascading_nlu`/`test_web_api_parameter_schemas`.
- [ ] **TEST-5** [TXTPROC] (P2) — _(coverage goal for TEST-7)_ Text-processor / normalizer coverage, after QUAL-12/13.

### Build & CI (BUILD)
- [x] **BUILD-1** (P0) — Verify clean `uv sync` + CLI and WebAPI boot at v15. **DONE 2026-06-01** (`bab6f97`):
      `uv sync --extra all` clean; `--check-deps` 5/5; **WebAPI** boots (workflow READY, 10 routers) and
      `POST /execute/command "привет"` → `greeting.hello` end-to-end; **CLI** boots and (after fix) headless
      `--command "привет"` works. Found+fixed a real bug: `--headless` disabled `nlu`/`text_processor` while the
      unified workflow requires `nlu` → headless could never execute a command. Observed (already-logged) cosmetics:
      QUAL-6 schema warning on boot; CLI banner still says "v14" (DOC-3 sibling).
- [ ] **BUILD-2** (P1) — Re-enable CI (`config-validation.yml` is manual-only; update deprecated
      `upload-artifact@v3` / `setup-python@v4`).
- [ ] **BUILD-3** (P2) — **DEFERRED to the release phase (decided 2026-06-01): Docker builds are an end-stage
      task**, after the architecture/code work settles (image contents, extras, and armv7 viability all depend on
      the post-refactor shape — incl. QUAL-19/20 [ESP32] and ARCH-9/10 [INFER] for the sherpa-onnx/runtime
      footprint). Then verify the minimal x86_64 Docker build (builder feeds analyzer package names to
      `uv sync --extra`, which expects extra *names* — confirm/fix) + container boots CLI/WebAPI. Gates
      Definition-of-release item #1. Refs: README-DOCKER, build audit.
- [ ] **BUILD-4** (P1) — config-ui builds & type-checks clean (`npm ci && npm run type-check && npm run build`;
      `dist` is git-ignored). Per Invariant #4 this is an **ongoing gate** — add it to CI (BUILD-2) so backend
      contract changes that break config-ui are caught.

### Models & Assets (ASSET)
- [x] **ASSET-1** — Refresh stale model IDs (Anthropic→Claude 4.x, Whisper large-v3, ElevenLabs multilingual_v2, spaCy 3.8, gpt-4→gpt-4o-mini). → fc85306
- [ ] **ASSET-2** (P1) — Liveness-check all model download URLs after the pause (`models.silero.ai` → prefer
      torch.hub as a hedge; openWakeWord v0.5.1; alphacephei vosk). **Caveat:** test **off the VPN/proxy** before
      declaring any host dead — this network uses fake-IP mode (every host resolves into `198.18.0.0/15`), which is
      normal; the real failure signal is a connection **stall/ERR**, not the IP. Verified 2026-06-01: silero.ai,
      alphacephei, github, whisper-CDN and PyPI all reachable and serving real bytes (silero served the real 40MB
      `v4_ru.pt`), so the "silero flaky/dead" reputation was at least partly the proxy stall, not the host.
- [ ] **ASSET-3** (P2) — DEFERRED — Migrate `lingua-franca` off the abandoned MycroftAI git pin to the OVOS
      successors (`ovos-number-parser`/`ovos-date-parser`), or mirror/vendor. Refs: `pyproject.toml` note.

### Documentation (DOC)
- [x] **DOC-1** — Sync README/architecture to v15; archive ~28 historical docs to `docs/archive/`. → 4a55519
- [ ] **DOC-2** (P2) — Archive completed `docs/TODO/TODO0x`; mark `docs/TODO.md` superseded by this file; keep open TODO11 + partials.
- [ ] **DOC-3** (P2) — Fix cosmetic stale-version strings: "v13" in `irene/core/engine.py` docstrings/logs and the
      "v14" CLI banner in `irene/runners/cli.py` (`--help` description). Should read v15.
- [ ] **DOC-4** (P1) — Rewrite `architecture.md` to the harmonized current state **+ chosen target pattern**
      (do after pattern sign-off, so it's written once). Refs: phase1_architecture_map §3, §4, §5.
      Must also **document the fire-and-forget action flow** [FAF] (currently undocumented) and **retire
      `docs/fire_forget_issues.md`** once QUAL-8/9 land.
- [x] **DOC-5** (P1) — Fixed docs that CONTRADICT code: `donations_flow.md` + `intent_donation.md` (donation
      paths → `assets/donations/<handler>_handler/<lang>.json`, schema → `assets/donations/v1.0.json`),
      `ASSET_MANAGEMENT.md` (12 TOML-nesting fixes `[providers.X]`→`[X.providers]`), `train_schedule_handler.md`
      (env → `IRENE_INTENT_SYSTEM__TRAIN_SCHEDULE__*`), `voice_trigger.md` (YAML→TOML), and authoritative
      correction banners on `guides/DONATION_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md` + `plugins/universal_tts.md`.
- [ ] **DOC-5b** (P2) — Full regeneration of `guides/DONATION_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md` from the Pydantic
      `HandlerDonation`/`MethodDonation` models (currently fixed via banner only; body still uses old field names).
- [ ] **DOC-7** [PEX] (P1) — Canonical parameter-extraction reference (the design doc was archived; nothing
      current): authoring `ParameterSpec`, ParameterType semantics, token/slot pattern format, entity resolution,
      handler consumption of `intent.entities`. → `docs/guides/PARAMETER_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`. Derived from QUAL-10.
- [x] **DOC-6** (P2) — Archived stale historical-plan docs (`config_schemas`, `language_support`,
      `configuration_guide`, `PIPELINE_IMPLEMENTATION`, `irene_current`) → `docs/archive/`.
- [ ] **DOC-8** (P1) — **Data & context-models map** → `docs/guides/DATA_MODELS.md`. **Downstream of QUAL-25
      [DFLOW]** (re-categorized 2026-06-02): this is the *write-up* that distills the dataflow **review** into a
      concise developer reference; the investigation/findings now live in QUAL-25 → `docs/review/dataflow_review.md`.
      Do this **after** QUAL-25 lands, consuming its map + confirmed model lifecycle. A concise reference for how
      the pipeline's models play together — **when each is needed and why** (the request-scoped vs session-scoped
      distinction is the key confusion to resolve). Cover the cast + responsibilities: **`RequestContext`**
      (per-*request* input metadata — source, session_id, wants_audio, skip flags, client/room/device, language;
      created at the entry by the runner/web/cli) · **`UnifiedConversationContext`** (persistent per-*session* state
      — history, active/recent/failed actions, devices, `ConversationState`, `ContextLayer`; keyed by `session_id`,
      fetched via `ContextManager`) · **`Intent`** (NLU output) · **`IntentResult`** (handler output) ·
      **`AudioData`/`WakeWordResult`** (IO primitives). Document the **lifecycle**: `RequestContext` →
      `ContextManager.get_context(session_id)` → `UnifiedConversationContext` → `NLU → Intent` →
      `orchestrator.execute → IntentResult` → `context.add_to_history(...)`. State where each now lives post-ARCH-1/5
      (`intents/context_models.py`, `intents/models.py`, `utils/audio_data.py`). DOC-4 links to it. Refs:
      `phase1_architecture_map.md` §4.

### UI / config-ui (UI)
React/Vite donation+config editor. Front-end feature/UX work (the BUILD-4 build gate stays under Build & CI).
Governed by Invariant #4 (config-ui must stay functional).
- [ ] **UI-1** [DEDITOR] (P2) — Design a human-friendly donation/pattern authoring model: an abstraction over raw
      spaCy `token_patterns`/`slot_patterns` usable by a non-spaCy intent developer (literals, parameter slots
      mapped to the 8 ParameterTypes + entity resolvers, optionality/repetition, synonyms/lemmas) + an
      **"advanced (raw spaCy)" escape hatch**. → `config-ui/docs/donation_editor_ux.md`. **Depends on QUAL-10 [PEX].**
      (Today `TokenPatternsEditor`/`SlotPatternsEditor` expose raw spaCy directly; `ParameterSpecEditor` is already fine.)
- [ ] **UI-2** [DEDITOR] (P2) — Bidirectional translation layer (human model ↔ spaCy token/slot patterns) with
      round-trip fidelity + validation (must emit schema-valid spaCy). Decide frontend-only vs. a backend
      `compile/decompile` endpoint reusing the real spaCy logic.
- [ ] **UI-3** [DEDITOR] (P2) — Reimplement `TokenPatternsEditor`/`SlotPatternsEditor` on the new model (retain
      raw-spaCy advanced mode); add "test pattern against sample text" via the NLU recognize endpoint.
- [ ] **UI-4** [WORKFLOWVIZ] (P-deferred) — A config-ui **"Workflow Control" / pipeline-visualization page** (live
      React-Flow DAG of the component/provider pipeline, per-stage input/output inspection, provider switching, SSE
      updates). **Source design archived** at `docs/archive/workflow_control.md` (Sep-2025, never built). **Strongly
      gated — do NOT start before Gate 2:** the design assumes a clean pipeline, but QUAL-25 proved the real dataflow
      is broken at many hops (visualizing it now would faithfully render broken flow), and it specs `/workflow/*`
      endpoints that `architecture.md` §7 flags as **fictional** (they'd have to be built for real). Relates to the
      `MonitoringPage` placeholder and the **ARCH-7 [MQTT]** output-seam work (both touch live pipeline observability).
      Re-scope against the *fixed* pipeline + real endpoints when it's actually picked up. Captured from a config-ui
      doc reviewed during QUAL-25 (2026-06-02).
