"""BUG-25 — every other interactive CLI command was swallowed.

Root cause: TWO consumers raced `CLIInput`'s single command queue — the runner's interactive
loop (real) and `InputManager._listen_to_source`, which fed an internal queue that NOTHING
drained (dataflow review P0-8). asyncio alternates queue waiters, so command #1 was processed
and command #2 vanished. The fix deletes the manager's consumer outright: the manager owns
source LIFECYCLE only.
