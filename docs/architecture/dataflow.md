# Data flow

Trace a request and you watch the same intent take a few shapes: a string, then an `Intent` (a name and
some entities), then an `IntentResult`, then bytes on a channel. This page walks the cases that aren't
obvious from the pipeline alone.

## A synchronous command

The common case — "который час", a light toggle, a question — finishes in one turn:

1. The request arrives as audio or text, carrying its format and origin. Audio becomes text via ASR and
   the text processor; text skips straight past those.
2. **NLU** turns the text into an `Intent` — a name (`datetime.current_time`), entities and a confidence —
   driven by the donation files: a cheap keyword match first, spaCy when it's hard (see [NLU](nlu.md)).
3. The matched **handler** runs and returns an `IntentResult`: the reply text, whether to speak it, any
   actions.
4. The **OutputManager** sends it back to the channel that asked, picking the modality and degrading
   speech to text where a channel can't speak.

Voice and text differ only at step 1 — *where* they enter; from NLU onward the path is identical. When a
handler needs something it doesn't have — an LLM that's offline, a device that isn't there — it doesn't
crash: it returns a spoken explanation or asks a clarifying question.

## Fire-and-forget, and deferred results

Some commands can't finish in one turn — a five-minute timer, a long-running action. These split in two:

- **Now** — the handler launches the work as a detached task, registers it in the **action store**
  (`ClientRegistry`) keyed by the request's **physical identity** (the room or device, not the
  conversation), and returns an instant acknowledgement.
- **Later** — when the task finishes, a completion is produced and handed to the OutputManager, addressed
  by that same physical identity. The result speaks in **the room that set the timer**, even though the
  conversation that started it is long gone.

Keying on the room/device rather than the conversation session is the whole trick: sessions expire, rooms
don't. A "стоп" said an hour later still finds the running task by the same key, and a fired timer still
knows where home is.
