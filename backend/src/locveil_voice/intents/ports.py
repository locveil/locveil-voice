"""
Domain capability ports (QUAL-24).

Hexagon (Invariant #3): intent **handlers are the domain** (innermost layer) and
must depend only on abstractions the domain owns — never reach outward into the
application/composition root. Previously the handlers fetched components via
`from ...core.engine import get_core` (a service-locator that made the domain
reach into core, transitively pulling components/inputs/workflows).

These ABCs are those domain-owned abstractions. Handlers depend on them
(sideways, within `intents/`); the application-layer components **inherit** them
(`components → intents.ports` is application→domain, i.e. inward) and the
application injects the components into the handlers. Making them abstract base
classes (not structural Protocols) means a component that fails to implement a
port method cannot be instantiated — the gap fails loudly at startup instead of
surfacing as a latent `AttributeError`.
